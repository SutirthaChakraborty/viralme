#### Tips for Using Video in Customer Journey Mapping

Customer journey mapping is a powerful tool for understanding and improving the customer experience. Adding video to your customer journey maps can enhance the visualization and engagement of your audience. Here are some tips for using video in customer journey mapping:

1. **Keep it concise**: When using video in customer journey mapping, it's important to keep the videos short and to the point. Aim for videos that are no longer than a few minutes to maintain the viewer's attention.

2. **Use storytelling**: Videos are a great medium for storytelling. Use videos to tell a story about the customer's journey, highlighting key touchpoints and emotions along the way. This can help your audience connect with the customer's experience on a deeper level.

3. **Include real customer testimonials**: Incorporating real customer testimonials in your videos can add authenticity and credibility to your customer journey maps. Hearing directly from customers about their experiences can make the journey more relatable and impactful.

4. **Add interactive elements**: To make your customer journey maps more engaging, consider adding interactive elements to your videos. This can include clickable hotspots, quizzes, or interactive overlays that provide additional information or context.

5. **Use captions and subtitles**: Including captions and subtitles in your videos can make them more accessible to a wider audience. This is especially important for viewers who are hearing impaired or prefer to watch videos without sound.

6. **Optimize for different devices**: Ensure that your videos are optimized for different devices and screen sizes. This will ensure that your customer journey maps can be viewed and enjoyed on various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and tablets.

    </div>
    
    <script>
        // JS code for interactive elements
        const hotspots = document.querySelectorAll('.hotspot');
        const overlays = document.querySelectorAll('.overlay');
        
        hotspots.forEach((hotspot, index) => {
            hotspot.addEventListener('click', () => {
                overlays[index].style.display = 'block';
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code includes CSS styles for interactive elements such as hotspots and overlays. The JS code adds functionality to display the overlays when the hotspots are clicked. You can customize the positions and styles of the hotspots and overlays to fit your specific needs.

Remember to replace the `customer_journey_video.mp4` with the actual video file you want to use.

I hope this helps you create interactive and engaging customer journey maps using video!
