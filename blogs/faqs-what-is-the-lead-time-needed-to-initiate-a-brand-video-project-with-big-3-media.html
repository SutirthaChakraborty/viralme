    <div class=\"question\">What is the lead time needed to initiate a brand video project with Big 3 Media?</div>
    <div class=\"answer\">Our team prides itself on providing fast and efficient service to our clients. The lead time for a brand video project varies depending on the complexity of the project and the availability of our team members. However, we typically require at least two weeks' notice to begin work on a new project. This allows us to properly plan and execute the project to ensure that it meets your expectations.</div>
