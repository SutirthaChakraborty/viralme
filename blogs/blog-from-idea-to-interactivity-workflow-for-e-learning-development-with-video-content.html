#### Explanation of the Code
The provided HTML code creates a simple webpage for an e-learning development blog with video content. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML document is structured with the necessary elements such as `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. The `<header>` and `<main>` sections are used for the header and main content of the webpage.

- **Interactive CSS**: The CSS styles are used to define the visual presentation of the blog. It includes styling for the header, main content, and video player.

- **Interactive JavaScript**: A JavaScript function `playVideo()` is included to enable the video playback when the "Play Video" button is clicked.

- **Video Content**: The `<video>` tag is used to embed a video in the blog, and a "Play Video" button triggers the playback using JavaScript.

This code provides a foundation for creating an interactive e-learning development blog with video content, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to engage users and deliver valuable educational material.
