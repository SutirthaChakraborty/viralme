<body>
    <h1>Category Headshots</h1>
    
    <div class="headshot-container">
        <div class="headshot" style="background-image: url('headshot1.jpg')"></div>
        <div class="headshot" style="background-image: url('headshot2.jpg')"></div>
        <div class="headshot" style="background-image: url('headshot3.jpg')"></div>
        <!-- Add more headshots here -->
    </div>
    
    <script>
        // JavaScript for interactivity (optional)
        const headshots = document.querySelectorAll('.headshot');
        
        headshots.forEach(headshot => {
            headshot.addEventListener('click', () => {
                // Perform an action when a headshot is clicked
                console.log('Headshot clicked!');
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple webpage that displays category headshots. The headshots are represented by circular div elements with a specified width and height. The CSS code provides styling for the headshots, including a hover effect that scales the headshot when the cursor is over it. The headshots can be customized by changing the background image URLs in the `style` attribute of each `headshot` div.

Additionally, the code includes an optional JavaScript section that adds interactivity to the headshots. In this example, a click event listener is added to each headshot, which logs a message to the console when a headshot is clicked. You can modify this JavaScript code to perform any desired action when a headshot is clicked.

Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS code to suit your specific needs.
