    <h2>What is Internet Explorer?</h2>
    <p>Internet Explorer (IE) was a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft. It was first released as part of the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser family on October 13, 1995. Over the years, IE evolved, incorporating various features and technologies to improve web browsing experience. However, it faced criticism for its compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and lack of support for web standards.</p>
    <h2>Decline and Retirement</h2>
    <p>In June 2016, Microsoft announced that it would stop supporting Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10 in favor of newer browsers like Microsoft Edge. This decision marked the end of an era for IE, which had been a cornerstone of the web browsing experience for many years. Despite its retirement, IE's legacy continues to influence the development of web browsers and the evolution of the internet.</p>
