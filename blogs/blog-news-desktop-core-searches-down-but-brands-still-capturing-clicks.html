This is a concerning issue for businesses as it means that users are relying more on branded searches rather than generic ones.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        To combat this, businesses need to focus on creating engaging and relevant content that will capture the attention of their target audience. This can be achieved through the use of interactive CSS and JS elements such as animations and pop-ups.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Additionally, businesses should also consider optimizing their website for search engines by using relevant keywords and meta descriptions. This will help increase visibility and drive more traffic to their site.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"highlight\">\n        Interactive CSS and JS elements can be used to make your website more engaging and user-friendly. For example, you could add an animation to a button that changes its color when clicked or create a pop-up that displays additional information about a product or service.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        By implementing these strategies, businesses can improve their online presence and attract more customers to their site. Remember to always prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to content creation and search engine optimization.\n    </p>\n</body>\n</html>
