#### Interactive CSS and JS Explanation

To enhance user interaction and engagement, JavaScript can be used to create dynamic elements within the project. For example, JavaScript can introduce accordions within the FAQ section, where each FAQ title functions as a toggle switch, expanding or collapsing the corresponding answer upon user click. Additionally, a visual indicator in the form of an icon can dynamically change between a plus and a times symbol to signify the current state of each accordion, adding a layer of user engagement and interactivity to the project [[1]](https://codewithcurious.com/projects/netflix-clone-using-html-css-and-js/).

In terms of CSS, various properties and techniques can be utilized to style the web page, including background colors, font styles, and layout management. For instance, the use of linear-gradient background colors, box-shadow declarations, and CSS modules or styled components can significantly enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the web page [[2]](https://blog.theodo.com/2018/06/write-better-css-part-1/).

By incorporating these interactive elements and styling techniques, the HTML and CSS code for the Hellbound review can effectively capture the thematic concerns and thought-provoking narrative of the Netflix series, providing an engaging and responsive user interface for the audience.
