        <h1>Facebook Rolls Out Scheduled Unpublished Posts for Marketers: Social Content Gets Targeting Lift</h1>
        <p>Facebook has recently introduced a new feature called <span class="highlight">Scheduled Unpublished Posts</span> for marketers. This feature allows marketers to schedule and publish posts on Facebook at a later time without making them immediately visible to the public.</p>
        <p>With this feature, marketers can plan their social media content in advance and target specific audiences based on their interests, shopping habits, browsing habits, and more. This targeted approach helps to increase engagement and reach among the desired audience.</p>
        <p>To use this feature, marketers can simply create a post as they normally would and choose the option to schedule it for a later date and time. The post will remain unpublished until the scheduled time, at which point it will be automatically published on Facebook.</p>
        <p>This new feature provides marketers with greater flexibility and control over their social media content strategy, allowing them to optimize their campaigns and maximize their reach.</p>

In this code snippet, I have created a simple HTML page with a container div that holds the content. The CSS styles the page with a clean and modern look, including a centered heading, paragraphs, and a highlighted section for key points.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you can further customize the HTML and CSS according to your specific needs and design preferences.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
