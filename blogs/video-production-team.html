Please note that the code above is in plain text format and may not be renderable as HTML in this chat interface. To use it, you can copy the code and save it as an HTML file, then open it in a web browser to see the rendered output.

The code includes CSS styling to format the page layout and design, and JavaScript to add interactivity. It creates a simple page with two team members in a video production team, including their names, roles, descriptions, and contact buttons. When the contact buttons are clicked, an alert message will be displayed saying which button was clicked.

Feel free to customize the code as per your requirements and add more team members or information.
