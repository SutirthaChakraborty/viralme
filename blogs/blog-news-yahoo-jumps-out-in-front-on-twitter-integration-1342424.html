This HTML code creates a basic structure for a blog news website. It includes a header with the title "Blog News," a main section for the articles, and a simple CSS styling to make the website visually appealing.

Feel free to add more articles by duplicating the `<article>` section and updating the content accordingly. You can also customize the CSS styles to match your desired design.

Remember to replace the placeholder content with actual news articles and update the publication dates accordingly.

I hope this helps you get started with your blog news website! Let me know if you have any further questions.
