      <h2>Women More Active in Social Media Than Men</h2>
      <p class="post-meta">Published on August 10, 2024 by John Doe</p>
      <p>A recent study has found that women are more active on social media platforms than men. The study, conducted by the Pew Research Center, analyzed data from various social media platforms and found that women tend to spend more time on these platforms, engage more with content, and have larger social networks.</p>
      <p>The study also found that women are more likely to use social media for personal and social reasons, such as staying connected with friends and family, while men tend to use social media for more professional and informational purposes.</p>
      <p>The findings of this study have important implications for businesses and marketers, who need to tailor their social media strategies to better reach and engage with their target audiences.</p>
