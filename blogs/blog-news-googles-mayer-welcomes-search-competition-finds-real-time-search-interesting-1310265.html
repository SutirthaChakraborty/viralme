#### Explanation of the HTML Code

The provided HTML code creates a simple blog news website with two articles. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<header>` element contains the website's title, "Blog News".
- The `<main>` element is the container for the articles.
- Each article is represented by a `<div>` element with the class "article".
- Inside each article, there is an `<h2>` element for the article title and two `<p>` elements for the article content and publication date.
- The CSS styles defined in the `<style>` section give the website a clean and modern look. The styles include a dark header, a white background for the articles, and some spacing and formatting adjustments.

Feel free to modify the HTML code and add more articles or customize the styles to suit your needs.
