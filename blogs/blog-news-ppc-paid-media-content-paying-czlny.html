#### Explanation of the HTML Code

The provided HTML code creates a simple blog on the topic of PPC (Pay-Per-Click) and paid media content. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<header>` section contains the blog title.
- The `<main>` section contains the blog posts, each wrapped in an `<article>` element.
- Each blog post has a `<h2>` heading for the title, a `<p>` element for the publication date, and a `<p>` element for the content.
- The `<footer>` section contains the copyright notice.

#### Interactive CSS and JS

To make the blog more interactive, you can add CSS and JS code to enhance the user experience. Here are a few examples:

1. Add a hover effect to the blog post titles:
css
.post h2:hover {
  color: #ff0000;
}


2. Implement a "Read More" button that expands the content of each blog post when clicked:
html
<article class="post">
  <h2>Introduction to PPC</h2>
  <p class="post-meta">Published on August 11, 2024</p>
  <p>PPC (Pay-Per-Click) is an online advertising model in which advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. It is a popular form of paid media that allows businesses to drive targeted traffic to their websites and increase brand visibility.</p>
  <button class="read-more">Read More</button>
</article>

<script>
  const readMoreButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.read-more');
  readMoreButtons.forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      button.previousElementSibling.classList.toggle('expanded');
    });
  });
</script>

<style>
  .post p:not(.post-meta) {
    max-height: 100px;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition: max-height 0.3s ease;
  }
  .post p.expanded {
    max-height: none;
  }
</style>
