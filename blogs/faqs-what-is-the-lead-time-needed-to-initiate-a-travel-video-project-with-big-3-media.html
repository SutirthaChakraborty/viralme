#### Explanation:
- The HTML code above creates a simple webpage to provide information about the lead time needed for a travel video project with Big 3 Media.
- The `<style>` section includes basic CSS for styling the page, such as setting the background color, font, and container layout.

#### Interactive CSS and JS:
To enhance the interactivity of the webpage, additional JavaScript can be incorporated to create dynamic elements, such as a form for users to submit their project details and receive an estimated lead time in real-time. This can further engage users and provide a more interactive experience on the webpage.

By incorporating JavaScript, the webpage can dynamically update the lead time based on user input, providing a more engaging and interactive experience for visitors.

Remember, the specific implementation of interactive features would depend on the requirements and goals of the webpage.
