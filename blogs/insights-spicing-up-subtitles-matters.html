#### HTML Code with CSS: Insights on Spicing Up Subtitles

Here's a small HTML code snippet that demonstrates how to spice up subtitles using CSS:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Spicing Up Subtitles</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS for the subtitle */
        .subtitle {
            font-size: 1.2em;
            color: #ff0000;
            text-transform: uppercase;
            letter-spacing: 2px;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Main Title</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Spicy Subtitle</h2>
    <p>This is the content of the webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>


In this code snippet, we have a simple HTML structure with a main title (`<h1>`) and a subtitle (`<h2>`) styled using CSS. The CSS code is embedded within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

The CSS code targets the `.subtitle` class and applies the following styles:
- `font-size: 1.2em;` sets the font size of the subtitle to 1.2 times the default size.
- `color: #ff0000;` sets the color of the subtitle to red.
- `text-transform: uppercase;` transforms the text of the subtitle to uppercase.
- `letter-spacing: 2px;` adds a spacing of 2 pixels between each letter in the subtitle.
- `margin-bottom: 10px;` adds a bottom margin of 10 pixels to the subtitle, creating some spacing between the subtitle and the content below.

Feel free to modify the CSS styles to suit your preferences and design requirements. Remember to include this code within the `<body>` section of your HTML document.

By using this code snippet, you can easily spice up your subtitles and make them more visually appealing.
