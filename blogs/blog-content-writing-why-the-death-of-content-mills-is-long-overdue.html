        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Writing a blog post that ranks for a keyword is difficult, and ranking on the first page for that term is even harder. It requires careful analysis of a keyword's relevance to what your audience is actually looking for, followed by an evaluation of the content that's ranking for that keyword. **Content mills**, which pay freelance content writers cheap wages to churn out keyword-laden copy for SEO purposes, have long been criticized for their low-quality output and negative impact on domain authority [[1]].</p>

        <h2>The Problem with Content Mills</h2>
        <p>Content mills are services that prioritize quantity over quality, producing high volumes of passable content that often lacks depth and originality. Dumping such content into the web isn't effective and can even harm domain authority, especially if keyword stuffing is involved [[1]].</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on creating valuable and engaging content, content mills prioritize using words as containers for ads or creating filler for company blogs that are just good enough [[1]].</p>
