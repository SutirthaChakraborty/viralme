        <h1>Bing Adds Airport Maps to Search</h1>
        <p>Bing, the popular search engine, has recently announced a new feature that enhances its search capabilities - airport maps. With this new addition, users can now search for specific airports and get detailed maps of the terminals, gates, and other important locations within the airport.</p>
        <p>This feature comes in handy for frequent travelers who want to quickly find their way around the airport or locate specific amenities such as restaurants, lounges, or shops.</p>
        <p>To access the airport maps, simply perform a search on Bing using the name or code of the airport followed by the keyword "map." For example, searching for "JFK airport map" will display the map of John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.</p>
        <p>This addition to Bing's search capabilities demonstrates the search engine's commitment to providing users with relevant and useful information. It is yet another step towards making search results more interactive and engaging.</p>
