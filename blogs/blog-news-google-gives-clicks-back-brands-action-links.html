#### Explanation of the HTML Code

The HTML code provided above creates a basic structure for a blog news website. Here's a breakdown of the different sections:

- The `<header>` element contains the website's title, "Blog News".
- The `<main>` element is the main content area of the webpage.
- Inside the `<main>` element, there are two `<article>` elements representing individual blog news articles.
- Each `<article>` element contains an `<h2>` heading for the article title and a `<p>` paragraph for the article content.
- The article titles are wrapped in `<a>` tags to make them clickable links.
- The CSS styles defined in the `<style>` section are used to style the webpage, including the background color, font, spacing, and link styles.
