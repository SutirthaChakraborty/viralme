        <div class="answer">The ideal length for a commercial video depends on various factors, including the platform, target audience, and the message you want to convey. However, research suggests that shorter videos tend to perform better in terms of engagement and retention. **Studies have shown that videos between 15 to 30 seconds** have higher completion rates and are more likely to capture viewers' attention [[8]].

        It's important to keep in mind that the attention span of viewers is generally shorter, especially when it comes to online content. Therefore, it's recommended to focus on creating concise and impactful videos that deliver the key message effectively within a shorter duration.

        However, it's also worth noting that the optimal video length may vary depending on the specific context and goals of your commercial. For example, some platforms like YouTube allow for longer videos, and certain industries or products may require more time to showcase their features or benefits.

        Ultimately, it's essential to test and analyze the performance of your commercial videos to determine the optimal length for your target audience and goals. Consider conducting A/B testing or gathering feedback from your viewers to refine your video strategy and maximize its effectiveness.</div>
