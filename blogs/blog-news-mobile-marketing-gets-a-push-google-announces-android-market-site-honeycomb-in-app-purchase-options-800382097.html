## Interactive CSS Example:

css 
div {
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}
 
This CSS code creates a div with a light gray background color, some padding around the edges, and a small margin. You can use this as a starting point for your own CSS styles. 
 
## Interactive JS Example: 
 
js 
x = document.getElementById('demo'); 
x.innerHTML = 'Hello World!'; 
 
This JavaScript code selects an element with the ID of 'demo' and changes its content to 'Hello World!'. You can use this code to add interactivity to your website by modifying the selector or adding additional functionality.
