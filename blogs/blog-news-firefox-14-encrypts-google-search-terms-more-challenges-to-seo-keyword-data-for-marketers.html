    <h1>Blog News: Firefox 14 Encrypts Google Search Terms, More Challenges to SEO</h1>
    <p>Firefox 14 has introduced a new feature that encrypts Google search terms. This means that marketers will need to find alternative ways to track and analyze user behavior on their website.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyword data for marketers</strong>: Marketers can still use keyword data to optimize their content, but they may need to be more creative in finding relevant keywords.</li>
        <li><strong>Related keywords</strong>: Related keywords can help marketers find new opportunities and expand their reach. Examples include \"SEO tips\", \"marketing strategies\", and \"online advertising\".</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive CSS and JS</strong>: To demonstrate the impact of the encrypted search terms, we can create an interactive example using CSS animations and JavaScript. Visitors can hover over different words to see their original text before encryption.</li>
    </ul>
