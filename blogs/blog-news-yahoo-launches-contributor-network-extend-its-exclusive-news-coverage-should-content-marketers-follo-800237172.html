                <h3>Yahoo Launches Contributing Network</h3>
                <p>Yahoo has announced the launch of its new Contributing Network, which aims to expand its exclusive news coverage by inviting more content creators and influencers to share their stories with the world.

This is a significant move for Yahoo as it seeks to differentiate itself from other media outlets and attract more users to its platform.</p>
