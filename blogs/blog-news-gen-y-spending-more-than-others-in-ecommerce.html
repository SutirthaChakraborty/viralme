    const highlightParagraph = document.querySelector('.highlight');
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.textContent = 'Show More';
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      highlightParagraph.classList.toggle('expanded');
      button.textContent = highlightParagraph.classList.contains('expanded') ? 'Show Less' : 'Show More';
    });
