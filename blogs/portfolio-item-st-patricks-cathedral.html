It was built between 1878 and 1889 and dedicated on March 17, 1889. The cathedral is an example of Gothic Revival architecture and is considered one of the finest examples of this style in the world. Its design incorporates elements from medieval Irish churches, such as the use of ribbed vaults and pointed arches. The cathedral is also known for its stunning stained glass windows, which were designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and installed between 1886 and 1893. \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>
