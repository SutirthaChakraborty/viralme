        <h1>Blog News Consumers Trusting Businesses with Social Presences</h1>
        <p>If your company has a great blog that's regularly updated, re-purposing posts for social media is an easy way to drive traffic to your brand and keep your audience engaged and informed. Social media is a great place to promote your company's events, like workshops, webinars, and online chats. Sharing events can be an effective way to generate excitement, engage with your audience, extend reach, and increase turnout.</p>
        <p>Try the rule of thirds for tweeting: 1/3 promoting your business, 1/3 sharing personal stories, and 1/3 sharing insights from experts or influencers.</p>
        <p>To build new social alliances, search for social network bios that contain keywords related to your post, and mention those accounts. Hashtags are words or phrases combined together and preceded by the # symbol. You can use them to identify content, brands, themes, trends, and campaigns.</p>
        <p class="quote">"Blogging is proven to benefit small businesses as a cost-effective marketing method, and when done right, it can dramatically increase revenue."</p>
