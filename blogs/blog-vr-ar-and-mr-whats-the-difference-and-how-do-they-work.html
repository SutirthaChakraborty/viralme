However, there are some key differences between these technologies.</p>\n        <p>In VR, users are completely immersed in a virtual environment that is designed to mimic the real world as closely as possible. This can be achieved through the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs) that track the user's head movements and adjust the virtual environment accordingly. Users can interact with objects in the virtual world using controllers or hand gestures.</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, AR overlays digital content onto the real world in a semi-transparent layer. This can be done using mobile devices or specialized AR眼镜. While AR can be used for a variety of purposes, such as adding information to maps or displaying product reviews, it is often less immersive than VR.</p>\n        <p>Finally, MR combines elements of both VR and AR by allowing users to interact with both the virtual and real worlds simultaneously. This can be achieved through the use of special glasses or headsets that track the user's gaze and adjust the virtual environment accordingly. For example, a user might look at a book on a table and see an interactive 3D model of the book appear in their view.</p>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>
