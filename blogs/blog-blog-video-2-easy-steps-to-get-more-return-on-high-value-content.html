html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Blog Video</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles for the blog video */
        .video-container {
            position: relative;
            padding-bottom: 56.25%;
            padding-top: 30px;
            height: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
        
        .video-container iframe,
        .video-container object,
        .video-container embed {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
        
        .steps-container {
            margin-top: 20px;
            padding: 10px;
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
        }
        
        .step {
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }
        
        .step-number {
            font-weight: bold;
            font-size: 18px;
            color: #333;
        }
        
        .step-description {
            font-size: 16px;
            color: #666;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="video-container">
        <!-- Replace the URL below with the URL of your blog video -->
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/your-video-url" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    
    <div class="steps-container">
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>
            <span class="step-description">Optimize your high-value content with relevant keywords and meta tags.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span>
            <span class="step-description">Promote your high-value content through social media and email marketing campaigns.</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>


In this code snippet, we have a `<div>` element with the class "video-container" that holds an `<iframe>` element. You should replace the `src` attribute of the `<iframe>` with the URL of your blog video.

Below the video container, there is a `<div>` element with the class "steps-container" that contains two steps to get more return on high-value content. Each step is represented by a `<div>` element with the class "step". The step number is displayed using the "step-number" class, and the step description is displayed using the "step-description" class.

Feel free to modify the CSS styles in the code snippet to match your preferences and branding.

Remember to include the necessary CSS and JS files in your HTML document if you want to add interactive CSS and JS to explain the topics further.

I hope this helps you get started with creating your blog video and incorporating the two easy steps to get more return on high-value content!
