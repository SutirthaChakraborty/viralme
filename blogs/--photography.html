            Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light
            or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or
            chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is a popular
            hobby, creative outlet, and profession.

            In addition to technical skills, photography requires an understanding of composition, lighting,
            and subject matter. It can be used for various purposes such as capturing memories, documenting
            events, advertising, and artistic expression.
