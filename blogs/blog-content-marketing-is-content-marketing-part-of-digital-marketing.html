Sure, I can help with that! Here's a small HTML code with CSS and JS to explain the topic of "Is content marketing part of digital marketing?" using interactive elements:

HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Content Marketing & Digital Marketing</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Content Marketing & Digital Marketing</h1>
  <p>Content marketing is a crucial part of digital marketing. It involves creating and sharing valuable, relevant content to attract and engage a target audience.</p>
  <p>Keywords like "content strategy," "SEO," "social media," "engagement," and "audience targeting" are important in content marketing for better reach.</p>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


CSS (styles.css):

body {

}

h1 {

p {
  color: #333;
