Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an example of interactive, colorful HTML code for a startup-themed webpage:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Startup Information</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f4f4f4;
            text-align: center;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #2e86de;
        }
        p {
            color: #333;
        }
        button {
            padding: 10px 20px;
            background-color: #2ecc71;
            color: #fff;
            border: none;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        button:hover {
            background-color: #27ae60;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Startup World!</h1>
    <p>Startups are innovative and dynamic ventures that aim to solve problems and create value.</p>
    <button onclick="learnMore()">Learn More</button>
  
    <script>
        function learnMore() {
            const info = "Startups are often characterized by their agility, risk-taking, and disruptive potential.";
            alert(info);
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code includes interactive CSS and JS to explain the topic of startups. When the user clicks the "Learn More" button, they will see an alert with additional information about startups.
