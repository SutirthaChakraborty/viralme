  <h2>Big 3 Media Cancellation Policies</h2>
  
  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">What are the cancellation policies for motion graphics videos?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      For motion graphics videos, the cancellation policy typically allows for a 14-day notice period prior to the scheduled production date. This gives us enough time to adjust our schedules and resources. Please note that there may be additional fees for cancellations made within the 7-day window prior to the scheduled date.

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">Is there any flexibility in the cancellation policy?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      Yes, we understand that circumstances can change. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to cancel your motion graphics video production, we encourage you to reach out to us as soon as possible. We will do our best to accommodate your request and discuss any potential adjustments or fees.
