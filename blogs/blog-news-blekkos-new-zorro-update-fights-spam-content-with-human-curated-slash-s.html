    <h2>Zorro Update: Fighting Spam with Human-Curated Slash Tags</h2>
    <p>The new version of search engine Blekko, called Zorro, has made significant improvements visually. The left sidebar clutter has been removed, and search relevance has been substantially increased by auto-including some 1,000 slash tags. This means that many results are hand-picked sites known to have high-quality content. Content farms can't get through slashtags, ensuring better search results compared to other search engines.</p>
    <p>Clicking on slash tags allows users to drill down into results relevant to that tag, further enhancing answer relevance.</p>
