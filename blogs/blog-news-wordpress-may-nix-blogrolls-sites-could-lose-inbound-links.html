This HTML code creates a basic structure for a blog news website. It includes a header with the website title, a main section with articles, and a footer with copyright information. The CSS styles define the appearance of the different elements, such as the font, colors, and spacing.

Feel free to customize the code to fit your specific needs and design preferences. You can add more articles, change the styling, and incorporate additional features as required.

Remember to replace the placeholder content with your own articles and update the publication dates accordingly.

I hope this helps you get started with your blog news website! Let me know if you have any further questions.
