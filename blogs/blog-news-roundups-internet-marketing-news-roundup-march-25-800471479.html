<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Blog News Roundup - March 25</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS styles for the blog news roundup */
    body {

      background-color: #f2f2f2;
      margin: 0;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    
    h1 {
      color: #333;
      text-align: center;
    }

  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Blog News Roundup - March 25</h1>
  
  <div class="news-item">
    <h2>Headline 1</h2>
    <p>Summary of the news article goes here...</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="news-item">
    <h2>Headline 2</h2>
    <p>Summary of the news article goes here...</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="news-item">
    <h2>Headline 3</h2>
    <p>Summary of the news article goes here...</p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Add more news items as needed -->
  
</body>
</html>


#### Explanation

- The HTML code starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the opening `<html>` tag.
- The `<head>` section contains the title of the webpage and the CSS styles.
- The CSS styles define the appearance of the blog news roundup. The body has a light gray background color, and the news items have a white background with rounded corners. The headlines are styled with a larger font size and a darker color.
- The `<body>` section contains the main content of the webpage. The `<h1>` tag displays the title of the blog news roundup.
- Each news item is represented by a `<div>` element with the class "news-item". Inside each news item, there is an `<h2>` tag for the headline and a `<p>` tag for the summary of the news article.
- You can add more news items by duplicating the `<div class="news-item">` section and modifying the headline and summary accordingly.

Feel free to customize the HTML code and add more CSS styles to match your specific requirements.
