#### HTML Code for FAQs with CSS

Here's a small HTML code snippet that you can use as a starting point for creating an FAQs section with CSS styling:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>FAQs</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS for FAQs */
        .faq {
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
        
        .question {
            font-weight: bold;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        
        .answer {
            display: none;
            margin-top: 10px;
        }
        
        .answer p {
            margin-bottom: 5px;
        }
        
        /* CSS for animation */
        .answer.show {
            display: block;
            animation: fade-in 0.5s ease-in-out;
        }
        
        @keyframes fade-in {
            from {
                opacity: 0;
            }
            to {
                opacity: 1;
            }
        }
    </style>
    <script>
        // JavaScript for toggling answers
        function toggleAnswer(index) {
            var answer = document.getElementById('answer-' + index);
            answer.classList.toggle('show');
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">What is the cancellation policy?</div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer-1">
            <p>The cancellation policy for the case study video is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cancellations made more than 7 days before the scheduled date will receive a full refund.</li>
                <li>Cancellations made between 7 days and 48 hours before the scheduled date will receive a 50% refund.</li>
                <li>No refunds will be provided for cancellations made less than 48 hours before the scheduled date.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Add more FAQs here -->
    
</body>
</html>


In this code, we have created a simple FAQs section with one question and answer. You can add more FAQs by duplicating the HTML code inside the `<div class="faq">` element and updating the question and answer content.

The CSS styles the FAQs section with a basic layout and animation. The JavaScript function `toggleAnswer` is used to toggle the visibility of the answer when the question is clicked.

Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS according to your specific requirements.
