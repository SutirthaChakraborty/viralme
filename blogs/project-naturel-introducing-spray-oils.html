Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a small HTML code with CSS to introduce spray oils and their natural benefits:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Project Naturel</h1>
  <p>Discover the natural goodness of spray oils and their benefits for your health and lifestyle.</p>
  <div class="oil-benefits">
    <h2>Key Benefits of Spray Oils</h2>

</html>
