    <h2>Principles for Clean HTML Code</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some best practices for writing clean HTML code:

      <li>Use unique class and id names for elements to target them easily with CSS and JavaScript [[3]].</li>
      <li>Properly structure your HTML documents with the <!DOCTYPE html> doctype, <html>, <head>, and <body> elements [[6]].</li>

      <li>Keep your code organized and well-documented with comments [[6]].</li>
      <li>Be consistent in your coding style and follow best practices [[10]].</li>
