This means that when a user clicks on a paid search ad for a news website, they will be prompted to sign up for the website's newsletter before being taken to the article. This is a great way for websites to increase their email list and engage with their audience in a more personalized way.</p>\n        <div class=\"interactive\">\n            <h2>Interactive Example</h2>\n            <p>Click the button below to see an example of how this integration works in action.</p>\n            <button onclick=\"alert('This is just an example, you won\'t actually be signed up for a newsletter!')\">Sign Up for Newsletter</button>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>
