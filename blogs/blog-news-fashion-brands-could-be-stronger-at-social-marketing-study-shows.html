#### Explanation

The HTML code provided above creates a simple blog page for news about fashion brands and their social marketing strategies. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<head>` section contains the title of the page and the CSS styles.
- The `<body>` section is divided into three main parts: the header, the container for the articles, and the footer.
- The header contains the title of the blog.
- The container holds the articles, each represented by a `<div>` with the class "article". Each article has a heading (`<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`) with relevant information about the topic.
- The footer displays the copyright information.

The CSS styles define the appearance of the page, including the background color, font styles, margins, and padding. The articles are styled with appropriate font sizes and colors to enhance readability.
