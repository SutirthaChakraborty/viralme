Sure, here's a small HTML code with CSS to illustrate the topics of video industry, NGO, and government:

HTML:
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video Industry, NGO, and Government</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background-color: #f4f4f4;
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      height: 100vh;
    }
    .content {
      text-align: center;
    }
    h1 {
      color: #333;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    p {
      color: #666;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="content">
    <h1>Video Industry, NGO, and Government</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of video industry, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government involvement in the video sector. The video industry plays a crucial role in modern society, and the collaboration between NGOs and government entities is essential for its development and regulation.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code provides a basic structure with CSS for styling. It includes a heading and a paragraph to introduce the topics of the video industry, NGOs, and government involvement.

For interactive features and JS, additional code would be needed depending on the specific functionality desired.
