    <h2>Importance of Timing in Email Marketing</h2>
    <p>**Timing can make or break an email marketing campaign's success**. Sending emails at the right time can significantly impact open rates and engagement. Research shows that sending emails on **Tuesdays and Thursdays** tends to yield better results, but the optimal timing can vary based on the target audience and industry.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML Emails vs. Plain Text Emails</h2>
    <p>When it comes to email marketing, there are two main types of emails: **plain text emails** and **HTML emails**. While plain text emails are simple and compatible with all email apps, HTML emails allow for more visually appealing designs, including images, fonts, and layouts, similar to a web page.</p>
    
    <h2>Using CSS in HTML Emails</h2>
    <p>**CSS plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing HTML emails**. However, it's important to use CSS selectively and in an email-friendly way to avoid potential issues with email client support and rendering. Inline CSS is often used to style HTML emails effectively.</p>
