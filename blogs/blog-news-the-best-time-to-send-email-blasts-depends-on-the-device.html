        <p>**The Best Time to Send Email Blasts**</p>
        <p>When it comes to sending email blasts, the best time depends on the device. For mobile users, it's often recommended to send emails during non-working hours, such as evenings and weekends, when people are more likely to check their personal devices. On the other hand, for desktop users, sending emails during working hours, especially mid-morning or mid-afternoon, may yield better open rates.</p>
