    <h1>Insights: The Magic of Green Screen</h1>
    <p>Green screen technology, also known as chroma keying, is a technique used in film and video production to replace a specific color (usually green) with another image or video. This allows filmmakers to create realistic and immersive visual effects, transport actors to different locations, and bring imaginary worlds to life.</p>
    <p>**Best practices** for using green screen technology include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a well-lit and evenly colored green screen backdrop</li>
      <li>Avoiding shadows and wrinkles on the green screen</li>
      <li>Using high-quality cameras and lenses for better image quality</li>
      <li>Matching the lighting and color temperature of the foreground and background</li>
      <li>Using professional video editing software to key out the green screen and composite the desired background</li>
    </ul>
    <p>**Some common uses** of green screen technology include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating realistic backgrounds for movies and TV shows</li>
      <li>Simulating different locations without the need for expensive travel</li>
      <li>Adding special effects and CGI elements to videos</li>
      <li>Enhancing virtual reality and augmented reality experiences</li>
      <li>Creating engaging and interactive presentations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By mastering the art of green screen technology, filmmakers and content creators can unlock endless creative possibilities and captivate audiences with stunning visual effects.</p>

This HTML code creates a webpage with a centered container that has a white background and a subtle box shadow. The content includes a title, paragraphs with information about green screen technology, a list of best practices, and a list of common uses. The key points in the text are highlighted in green using the `.highlight` class defined in the CSS.

Feel free to customize the code further to suit your needs and add any additional interactive CSS or JavaScript elements you desire.
