    <p>The TL-DR is that when you reach a certain level, the natural extension is to include interactivity. And right now, JavaScript is the best and most popular way to do this.

    <h2>How to Create a Roundup Post That Will Skyrocket Your Traffic to High Heavens</h2>
    <p>To look specifically for experts who can contribute to your roundup post, select the tags Blogger and Influencer. Once you have your results, the information you need to move forward should be readily available under the Contact Info section. At this point, you can use an external email marketing or outreach platform to send messages or reach out to the influencers. However, I suggest that you keep everything streamlined by doing your outreach within Ninja Outreach. Just click the Save Prospect button to add the contact to one of your lists. Just be casual yet professional, as if you're sending an email to a close friend. Know when to go big. If you're reaching out to thought leaders or company executives, don't hesitate to craft personalized messages for each of them. If you want to increase the chances of the influencers participating in your roundup, start early by interacting with them days (or even months) before sending your outreach email.</p>

    <h2>A Simple Guide to Creating an Expert Roundup Post</h2>
    <p>This idea could be converted into a roundup by asking experts "What is your number #1 productivity tip when working remotely?" Pro Tip: Whatever topic you choose, you want to make it as easy as possible for your experts to answer the question. Make your question specific and limit the scope so that busy experts can provide shorter answers. Your experts are likely going to be comprised of bloggers, marketers, or perhaps company executives. I did this successfully in my first roundup to collect answers from four people that I otherwise would not have been able to reach. If you followed these steps up to here, at this point you should have a great collection of awesome responses. Now, you need to put it together. Follow the suggestions below to get started. Your title needs three components: number of experts that participated, who the experts are and the topic the experts covered. As you can see, a roundup can really be about any topic. This is an excellent strategy to quickly establish yourself as an authority in your niche and provide valuable content to your audience.</p>

    <h2>HTML basics - Learn web development | MDN</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</p>

    <h2>Coding for Web Design 101: How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Work</h2>
    <p>Another example of JavaScript in action is a slide-in call-to-action (CTA), like the ones we put on our blog posts, which appears on the bottom right-hand side of your screen when you scroll past the end of the sidebar. Here's what it looks like: JavaScript is particularly useful for assigning new identities to existing website elements, according to the decisions the user makes while visiting the page. Anyone can learn to code, just like anyone can learn a new language. In fact, programming is kind of like speaking a foreign language -- which is exactly why they're called programming languages. Each one has its own rules and syntax that need to be learned step by step. Those rules are ways to tell your computer what to do. More specifically, in web programming, they're ways of telling your browsers what to do. The goal of this post is to, in plain English, teach you with the basics of HTML, CSS, and one of the most common programming languages, JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Free Course: Build A Blog From Scratch</h2>
    <p>You can either do math to determine the size, for example 6.83em, but another technique is to set a size on the top-color, for example hsl(55, 100%, 96%) 6.83em. Once it's equal to or greater than the bottom color's size, it will appear as a line and not a gradient, making it intuitive what to change it to. The blog we built! Prefer video?
