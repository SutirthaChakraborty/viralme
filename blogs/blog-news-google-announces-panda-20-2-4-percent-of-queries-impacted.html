In the above HTML code, I've created a simple webpage to provide information about the Google Panda 4.2 update. The page includes a header, a section for update information, and interactive CSS and JS to explain the impact of the update. When the user clicks the "Show Impact Details" button, it reveals additional details about the impact of the update, as per the guidance provided by Google [[1]](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality) [[2]](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/panda-update/). This webpage is designed to be informative and user-friendly, focusing on delivering the best possible user experience, in line with Google's recommendations.

This HTML code uses relevant keywords such as "Google Panda 4.2 Update," "Panda algorithm," "search improvements," and "user experience," which are important for better reach and search engine optimization.
