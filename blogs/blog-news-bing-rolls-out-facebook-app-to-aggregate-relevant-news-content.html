    <h1>Bing Rolls out Facebook App to Aggregate Relevant News Content</h1>
    <p>Bing has recently launched a new Facebook app that allows users to aggregate relevant news content from various sources. This feature is designed to help users stay informed about the latest news without having to visit multiple websites. The app uses machine learning algorithms to curate news stories based on user preferences and interests.</p>
    <div class="interactive-example">
        <h2>Interactive Example</h2>
        <p>Here's an example of how you might use this feature in your own website or blog. Simply copy the following code and paste it into the HTML of your page:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;div id="bing-news"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br></code></pre>
        <p>Then, add the following JavaScript code to your page:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-2.1.12.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br><br></code></pre>
        <p>Finally, replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual access token from the Bing News API. You can find more information on how to get an access token on the Bing News API documentation page.</p>
