#### Interactive CSS and JS Explanation
In the provided HTML and CSS code, we've created a simple webpage layout for showcasing training and education videos. The CSS includes styling for the overall layout, video container, and video description. The video is set to be responsive and the page has a clean, modern look.

To make the video container interactive, JavaScript can be used to add functionality such as dynamically loading different videos based on user interactions, creating a playlist, or adding features like video recommendations and user comments. This interactivity can greatly enhance the user experience and engagement with the educational content.

By incorporating relevant keywords such as "training," "education," "videos," "skills," and "knowledge," the code and content can better reach users searching for educational video resources.
