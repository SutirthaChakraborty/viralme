#### Interactive CSS and JS Explanation
To explain the topics of blog news marketing efforts on Facebook leading to mobile success, we can use interactive CSS and JS to create engaging visual representations of the key marketing tips mentioned in the HTML code. For example, we can use CSS animations to visually demonstrate the process of identifying and leveraging low-hanging-fruit topics, tracking metrics, and conducting keyword research. Additionally, JavaScript can be used to create interactive elements such as pop-ups or tooltips to provide further information about each marketing tip when users interact with specific elements on the page.

By incorporating interactive CSS and JS, we can enhance the user experience and provide a more engaging and informative presentation of the marketing strategies for Facebook success.
