        <h2>The Value Exchange</h2>
        <p>In any economy, the concept of value exchange is fundamental. This is where goods or services are exchanged for something of value, typically money. This process is what drives the market and allows for the creation of wealth. However, not all exchanges are equal, and sometimes, the value of an item or service can diminish over time.</p>
        <div class="value-exchange">
            <h3>Value Exchange</h3>
            <p>Value exchange is a mutual exchange of goods or services. It's a way for people to get what they need or want in a fair and beneficial manner. This concept is crucial for the functioning of any economy.</p>

        <h2>Losing Value</h2>
        <p>Losing value, on the other hand, refers to the decrease in the worth of an asset, product, or service over time. This can be due to various factors such as obsolescence, depreciation, or simply the passage of time. Understanding why and how value can be lost is essential for making informed decisions.</p>

        <h2>Interactive Example</h2>
        <p>Let's explore an interactive example to understand how value can be exchanged and lost.</p>
        <div class="interactive">
            <h3>Value Exchange Example</h3>
            <p>Enter the value of a product you're willing to trade: <input type="text" id="tradeValue"></p>
            <p>Enter the value of the product you're receiving: <input type="text" id="receivedValue"></p>
            <button onclick="calculateValueExchange()">Calculate</button>
            <p id="result"></p>
        </div>
        <script>
            function calculateValueExchange() {
                var tradeValue = document.getElementById("tradeValue").value;
                var receivedValue = document.getElementById("receivedValue").value;
                var result = "The value exchange is: " + (tradeValue - receivedValue);
                document.getElementById("result").innerText = result;
            }
