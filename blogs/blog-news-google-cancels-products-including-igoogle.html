This news has caused a stir among users who have grown accustomed to using iGoogle for their daily browsing needs.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"news\">\n            <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/600x400\" alt=\"Google Product Image\">\n            <h2>Google Cancels Other Products</h2>\n            <p>In addition to canceling iGoogle, Google has also announced that it will be canceling several other products, including Google+ and Google Wave. These products were not as widely used as iGoogle and did not generate as much revenue for the company. This move is expected to help Google focus on its core business of search and advertising.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>
