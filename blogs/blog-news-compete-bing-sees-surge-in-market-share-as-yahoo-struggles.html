        <p>Compete Bing sees surge in market share as Yahoo struggles.</p>
        <p>According to recent reports, Bing has grown to 19.7% of the US search market share, while Yahoo has seen a 10% increase in paid search clicks over the past year. This indicates that Bing is making strides in the search engine market, while Google's paid search clicks are down 11% from last year [[1]].</p>
        <p>As a result, small and medium-sized businesses should consider using Bing Ads as an alternative to Google Ads. Bing Ads offers benefits such as better ad positions and cheaper costs per click due to lower competition [[1]].</p>

#### Explanation:

The HTML code provided above creates a simple blog news webpage. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML document.
- The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and CSS styles.
- The `<title>` element sets the title of the webpage to "Blog News".
- The `<style>` element contains CSS styles for the webpage.
- The `<body>` element represents the content of the webpage.
- The `<div>` element with the class "container" is used to create a container for the blog news content.
- The `<h1>` element displays the heading "Blog News".
- The `<p>` elements contain the information about the surge in market share for Bing and the struggles of Yahoo, citing the relevant information from the search results [[1]](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/25/bings-ads-vs-google-adwords).

The CSS styles included in the `<style>` element define the appearance of the webpage. The `body` style sets the font family, background color, margin, and padding. The `.container` style sets the maximum width, margin, padding, background color, and box shadow for the container. The `h1` style sets the color and text alignment for the heading, and the `p` style sets the color and line height for the paragraphs.

Feel free to modify the HTML code and CSS styles to suit your needs and add more content as required.
