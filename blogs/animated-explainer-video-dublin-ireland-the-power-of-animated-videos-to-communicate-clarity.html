#### HTML Code for an Animated Explainer Video

To create an interactive and colorful HTML code for an animated explainer video, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an example of how you can structure the code:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Animated Explainer Video</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles for the video container */
        .video-container {
            position: relative;
            width: 100%;
            height: 0;
            padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
            overflow: hidden;
        }
        
        /* CSS styles for the video */
        .video {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="video-container">
        <video class="video" controls>
            <source src="your_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>

    <script>
        // JavaScript code for interactivity
        var video = document.querySelector('.video');
        
        // Play the video when clicked
        video.addEventListener('click', function() {
            if (video.paused) {
                video.play();
            } else {
                video.pause();
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


In this code, we have an HTML structure that includes a video container and a video element. The CSS styles ensure that the video is responsive and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio. The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the video, allowing it to play or pause when clicked.

To use this code, replace `"your_video.mp4"` with the URL or file path of your animated explainer video. You can also customize the CSS styles and JavaScript code to fit your specific requirements.

Remember to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML code if you're using external libraries or frameworks for additional functionality.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you can enhance the code further based on your specific needs and design preferences.
