This HTML code creates a simple webpage with CSS styling to display information about blog news on Google, Bing, Yahoo, and AOL, as well as honoring the royal wedding. The page is divided into sections, with each section represented by a "news-card" element. The CSS styles define the layout and appearance of the webpage, including the background color, font styles, and card design. You can add JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags to add interactivity to the webpage if needed.

Please note that this is a basic code snippet and can be customized further based on your specific requirements.
