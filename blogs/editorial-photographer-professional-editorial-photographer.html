        <h2>What is Editorial Photography?</h2>
        <p>Editorial photography is a form of photography that is used in magazines, newspapers, and online publications to illustrate stories, articles, and features. It aims to convey information, tell a story, or provide context to the reader. Unlike commercial photography, which is often focused on advertising products or services, editorial photography focuses on content and storytelling.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <p>-<strong>Narrative Use:</strong> Editorial photographers often work on projects that tell a story or convey a message.</p>
        <p>-<strong>Authenticity:</strong> The aim is to capture moments and images that are real, unfiltered, and authentic.</p>
        <p>-<strong>Contextual Depth:</strong> Images are chosen and edited to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the subject matter.</p>
        <h2>Interactive Example</h2>
        <div class="interactive">
            <img src="example-image.jpg" alt="Editorial Photography Example">
            <p>This image exemplifies the blend of storytelling and authenticity in editorial photography.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Editorial photography is a vital component of media that helps in informing, educating, and entertaining the audience. It requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, the ability to capture moments that convey the essence of the story, and a knack for editing that enhances the narrative.</p>
