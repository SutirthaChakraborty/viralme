Here is a small HTML code snippet with CSS that you can use to create a blog news video section on your website:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Blog News Video</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS styles for the blog news video section */
    .blog-news-video {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }
    
    .blog-news-video-item {
      width: 30%;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
      padding: 10px;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
      border-radius: 5px;
    }
    
    .blog-news-video-item h3 {
      font-size: 18px;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
    
    .blog-news-video-item p {
      font-size: 14px;
      color: #666;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="blog-news-video">
    <div class="blog-news-video-item">
      <h3>Topic 1</h3>
      <p>Information about topic 1.</p>
      <video src="video1.mp4" controls></video>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-news-video-item">
      <h3>Topic 2</h3>
      <p>Information about topic 2.</p>
      <video src="video2.mp4" controls></video>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-news-video-item">
      <h3>Topic 3</h3>
      <p>Information about topic 3.</p>
      <video src="video3.mp4" controls></video>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


In this code snippet, we have created a section called "blog-news-video" that contains three items, each representing a topic. Each item has a heading, some information about the topic, and a video related to that topic. The CSS styles provided give a basic layout to the section and the items, including a responsive design with flexbox.

Feel free to customize the code according to your specific needs, such as adding more topics or modifying the styling. Remember to replace the video URLs (`video1.mp4`, `video2.mp4`, `video3.mp4`) with the actual URLs of your videos.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
