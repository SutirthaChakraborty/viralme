#### Explanation:

The HTML code provided above creates a simple blog website layout with a header, main content section, and footer. The CSS code styles the different elements of the website to make it visually appealing and engaging.

- The `<header>` element contains the website title and a navigation menu.
- The main content is wrapped in a `<section>` element with the class "main-content".
- Inside the main content section, there is an `<article>` element that represents a blog post.
- The `<footer>` element contains copyright information and contact details.

The CSS code styles the different elements of the website, including the header, navigation menu, main content section, and footer. It sets the background colors, font styles, and spacing to create an attractive layout.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you can customize the HTML and CSS code according to your specific requirements and design preferences.

Feel free to modify the code and add more features to make it more interactive and engaging for your audience.
