Sure! Here's a small HTML code snippet with CSS that you can use to create a blog news website:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Blog News</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Blog News</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>What's a Marketer to Do?</h2>
        <p>Cutts hints at new versions of Panda and Penguin in the near future.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Latest News</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Article Title</h3>
            <p>Article content goes here...</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Article Title</h3>
            <p>Article content goes here...</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 Blog News. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>


In this code snippet, I have created a basic structure for a blog news website. The `<header>` section contains the website title and a navigation menu. The `<section>` elements are used to display the main content, including the title and a paragraph about what a marketer should do. The `<footer>` section contains the copyright information.

To style this HTML code, you can create a separate CSS file called "styles.css" and link it in the `<head>` section of the HTML code. In the CSS file, you can define the styles for different elements, such as the header, section, and footer.

For interactive functionality, you can also include a JavaScript file called "script.js" and link it in the `<head>` section of the HTML code. In the JavaScript file, you can write code to handle user interactions or perform dynamic updates to the webpage.

Remember to replace the placeholder content with your own blog news information and customize the styles according to your preferences.

I hope this helps you get started with creating your blog news website using HTML and CSS!
