        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

    <h1>Google Connects the PPC and Organic Dots</h1>
    <p id="content">In the world of online advertising, PPC (Pay-Per-Click) campaigns have long been a popular choice for businesses to drive targeted traffic to their websites. However, Google has been working on connecting the dots between PPC and organic search results to provide a more holistic view of website performance. By analyzing user behavior and search intent, Google aims to deliver more relevant and personalized search results to users.</p>

    <script>
        // Call the highlightText function to highlight the keyword "PPC"
        highlightText();
    </script>
</body>
</html>


In this code snippet, we have a basic HTML structure with a title, heading, and paragraph. The CSS styles define the appearance of the elements, including font styles, colors, and margins. The JavaScript function `highlightText()` is used to dynamically highlight the keyword "PPC" in the paragraph by adding a yellow background color.

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS styles to match your preferences and branding. You can also add more interactive features or customize the design further based on your needs.

Remember to include relevant keywords in your content to improve reach and visibility. Use **useful related keywords** that are relevant to your blog topic and can help attract a wider audience.

I hope this HTML code snippet helps you get started with your blog news article. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
