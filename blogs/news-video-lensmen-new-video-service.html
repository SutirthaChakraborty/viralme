In this code snippet, we have a container (`<div class="video-container">`) that holds the video element (`<video>`) and the title and description of the video. The CSS styles provided make the video container responsive, ensuring that the video adjusts to different screen sizes. The video is displayed using the `<video>` tag, and you can add multiple `<source>` elements inside it to support different video formats.

Feel free to customize the code according to your needs, such as changing the video source, adjusting the styles, or adding more content. Remember to replace `"path/to/video.mp4"` with the actual path to your video file.

Please note that this code snippet is a basic example and may require additional modifications and enhancements based on your specific requirements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
