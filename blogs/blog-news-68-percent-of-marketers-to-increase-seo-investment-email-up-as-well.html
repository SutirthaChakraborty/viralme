#### Explanation:

The HTML code provided above creates a simple webpage for a blog news article. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<title>` tag sets the title of the webpage to "Blog News".
- The CSS styles are defined within the `<style>` tags. These styles define the appearance of the webpage, including the font, background color, margins, padding, and text formatting.
- The content of the blog news article is enclosed within a `<div>` element with the class "container". This element provides a container for the content and applies some styling to it.
- The `<h1>` tag is used to display the heading "Blog News".
- The `<p>` tags are used to display paragraphs of text. The highlighted text is wrapped in a `<span>` element with the class "highlight" to apply a yellow background color and bold font weight.
- The text within the paragraphs provides information about the increasing SEO investment among marketers and the importance of using useful keywords in blog content.
- The closing `</div>`, `</body>`, and `</html>` tags close the respective elements and complete the HTML structure.
