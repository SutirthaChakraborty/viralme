      <h2>Topic: Search Trends for Consumers</h2>
      <p>Did you know that more than 63 percent of consumers use search engines daily? This means that businesses need to optimize their websites and content for search in order to reach their target audience. One trend that has emerged is the increasing reliance on longtail search queries. Longtail search queries are more specific and less common than traditional keywords, but they often yield better results because they are more relevant to the user's intent. By using useful related keywords, businesses can improve their search engine rankings and attract more targeted traffic to their website.</p>

  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>By using interactive CSS and JavaScript, you can enhance the user experience and make your blog post more engaging. For example, you could add some animations or interactive elements to illustrate the points you made in the article. With a little creativity and effort, you can turn your blog post into a powerful tool for promoting your business and driving traffic to your website.</p>
