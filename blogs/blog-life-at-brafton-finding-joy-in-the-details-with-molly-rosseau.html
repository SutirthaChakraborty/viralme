      <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="section-content">Creativity isn't just about putting words on a page or graphics on a pedestal. It's about conversations, too. Navigating what a client wants and how our creative production staff unite for delivery - like The Avengers with slightly less lycra - means you have to adapt and think on your feet. Molly Rosseau, a Senior Production Project Manager here at Brafton, relishes that challenge.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Life at Brafton</h2>
      <p class="section-content">As plates spin like planets around her, you'd imagine Molly leaves decisions to other people in her spare time. That isn't the case, though. She actually finds joy in strategizing more ways to have fun with her loved ones. Yeah, Molly's kind of an all-rounder: a master juggler scrutinizing each ball until it lands in her hands again. Being a master juggler, Molly found time in her busy schedule to tell us more about her life at Brafton and beyond.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="section-content">This gave Molly a taste of tantalizing commercial goals - the aim to not only represent what a brand does best, but also ensure she could meet more practical demands.</p>
