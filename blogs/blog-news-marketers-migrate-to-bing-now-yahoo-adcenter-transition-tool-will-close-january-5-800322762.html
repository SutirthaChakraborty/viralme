    <h1>Blog News Marketers Migrate to Bing</h1>
    <p>Bing has been powering Yahoo organic and paid searches for months, and marketers were told they should have migrated their accounts by mid-October to maximize holiday campaigns. Still, Yahoo says a small number of partners have not yet moved their accounts to the Microsoft adCenter. Yahoo explains that the transition tool in Yahoo Search Marketing accounts will be permanently removed tomorrow, January 5.</p>
    <p>Marketers can check their accounts' adCenter tab to determine whether or not they have successfully migrated accounts. Those who have not yet moved their data will see a Get Started button, while those who have will find this button is no longer available. Brands with campaigns for Microsoft and Yahoo may consider this transition a hassle, but advertising on these sites likely pays off. As Brafton reported, data shows that Bing and Yahoo are gaining search ground.</p>
