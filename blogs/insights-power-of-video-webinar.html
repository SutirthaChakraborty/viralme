    <h1>Insights Power of Video Webinar</h1>
    <p>
      You can use the same images you used to tease the webinar in the first place; you'll just be driving folks to the video content on your website now versus soliciting sign-ups for the live event. Transforming data and insights from your webinar into bite-sized graphics is a surefire way to engage your audience.
      And podcasts can be a great place to dive deeper into topics that you didn't have enough time to explore during the full broadcast. If you're on the hunt for more podcast material, webinars are Q&A hotbeds that can help that cause. If you have any leftover audience questions from your webinar, you can use your podcast as an opportunity to answer them. Even if they were answered in the webinar, you could still get your guest to revisit questions in more detail. Speaking of Q&A, the interactive elements of a webinar are a goldmine for repurposing content.
      If you're looking for short video clips to create based on your webinar, think about two things: informational value and entertainment.
