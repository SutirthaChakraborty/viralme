In the above code, we have a simple HTML structure with CSS styles for the page layout and the video section. The video section uses a responsive video wrapper to ensure that the embedded video maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio. The rest of the code provides information about commercial video production services, including the benefits and types of videos that can be produced.

Please note that the video source URL in the code (`https://www.youtube.com/embed/your-video-id`) should be replaced with the actual URL of the video you want to embed.

Feel free to modify the code and add any additional CSS or JavaScript as needed to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the page.
