#### Explanation:

The HTML code provided above creates a simple webpage that displays information about the blog news topic: "Bing Adjusts Social Sidebar to Let Users Tag Friends to Share SEO Results." The CSS styles included in the code are used to format the webpage and make it visually appealing.

The webpage consists of a container div that holds the content. Inside the container, there is a heading (h1) that displays the title of the blog news. Following the heading, there are several paragraphs (p) that provide information about the topic. At the bottom of the container, there is a citation (p) that indicates the source of the information.

The CSS styles define the font family, background color, and other visual properties of the webpage. The container div has a maximum width of 800px and is centered on the page using the margin property. The paragraphs have a slightly smaller font size and a line height of 1.5 to improve readability. The citation text is styled with a smaller font size and a different color to differentiate it from the main content.

This HTML code can be copied and used to create a webpage that displays the blog news about Bing adjusting its social sidebar. The CSS styles can be customized further to match the desired design and layout of the webpage.

Please note that this code is a basic example and may need to be modified or enhanced based on specific requirements and preferences.
