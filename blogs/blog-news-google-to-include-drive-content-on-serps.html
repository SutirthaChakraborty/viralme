Please note that this is a basic HTML code snippet and may require further customization based on your specific requirements and design preferences. You can modify the CSS styles and add additional functionality using JavaScript as needed.

Remember to replace the `DOCUMENT_ID`, `IMAGE_ID`, and `VIDEO_ID` placeholders with the actual IDs of your Google Drive documents, images, and videos.

Feel free to experiment with the code and customize it according to your needs. Good luck with your blog news website!
