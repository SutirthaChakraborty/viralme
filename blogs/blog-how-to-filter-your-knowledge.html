        <h1>How to Filter Your Knowledge</h1>
        <p>Filtering your knowledge is an essential skill to stay focused and efficient in the information age. With the abundance of information available, it's important to develop effective strategies to separate the valuable knowledge from the noise. Here are some tips to help you filter your knowledge:</p>
        
        <h2>1. Define Your Goals</h2>
        <p>Start by defining your goals and the specific areas of knowledge you want to focus on. This will help you filter out irrelevant information and prioritize what's important.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Curate Reliable Sources</h2>
        <p>Identify reliable sources of information related to your goals. Look for reputable websites, books, and experts in the field. Curating a list of trusted sources will save you time and ensure the quality of the knowledge you consume.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Use Keywords and Filters</h2>
        <p>When searching for information online, use specific keywords and filters to narrow down the results. This will help you find relevant and targeted information more efficiently.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Stay Organized</h2>
        <p>Organize the knowledge you acquire in a way that makes it easy to access and retrieve. Use tools like note-taking apps, bookmarks, or digital libraries to keep your knowledge organized and searchable.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Continuously Evaluate and Update</h2>
        <p>Regularly evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the knowledge you have. Update and refine your filters and sources as needed to ensure you stay up to date with the latest information.</p>
        
        <button onclick="showExample()">Click Me</button>
        
        <script>
            // JS for interactivity
