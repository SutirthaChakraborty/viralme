        <h2>Content Pruning</h2>
        <p>Content pruning is the practice of evaluating your content's performance and removing, refreshing, or repurposing content that isn't reaching its goal.</p>
        <p>For example, a blog article that has lost significant traffic or is not ranking well for its target keywords would be a good candidate for content pruning.</p>

    <section class="repurposing-info">
        <h2>Repurposing Content</h2>
        <p>Repurposing content with updated keywords and current information is an effective way to hold on to existing content while increasing its value.</p>
        <p>You can repurpose deleted content to create new, better-optimized pages, or find a new, more useful format for the information, such as turning it into an email sequence or social media content.</p>
