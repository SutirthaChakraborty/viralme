This HTML code creates a simple webpage with a container for the content. It includes a heading, a paragraph describing the services of the explainer video company in healthcare communication, and an embedded video section where you can replace `VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of your video.

The CSS styles the webpage with a clean and professional look. It sets the background color, font, and spacing. The video section is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

Feel free to customize the code further to fit your specific needs and design preferences.
