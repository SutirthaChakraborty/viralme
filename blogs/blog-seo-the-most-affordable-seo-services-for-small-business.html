Additionally, consider targeting specific locations based on geography if it aligns with your business goals [[2]].</p>
  
  <h2>HTML Tags for SEO</h2>
  
  <p>HTML tags play a crucial role in optimizing your website for search engines. Here are some important HTML tags to include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong>: The title tag is an essential HTML tag that appears in search engine results. Make sure to include relevant keywords in your title tag to improve visibility [[3]].</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;meta&gt;</strong>: The meta tags provide additional information about your web page, such as the meta description. Craft a compelling meta description that includes relevant keywords to attract users to click on your link [[1]].</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>: The heading tags, especially the h1 tag, help search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of your content. Use relevant keywords in your headings to improve SEO [[7]].</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Content Optimization</h2>
