      <p class="post-meta">Published on Saturday, August 10, 2024</p>
      <p class="post-content">According to a recent study, more than one third of Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) are planning to increase their social spending. This indicates the growing importance of social media in marketing strategies. CMOs recognize the potential of social platforms to reach and engage with their target audience. By investing in social spending, they aim to leverage the power of social media to drive brand awareness, customer acquisition, and overall business growth.</p>

This HTML code creates a simple blog news study page with a header, main content area for blog posts, and a footer. The CSS styles define the layout and appearance of the page, including the background color, font styles, and spacing.

Feel free to add more blog posts by duplicating the `<div class="post">...</div>` section and updating the content inside.

Remember to replace the content with your own relevant information and customize the design as needed.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
