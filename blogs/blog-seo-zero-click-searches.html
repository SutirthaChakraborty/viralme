        <h1>Blog SEO and Zero-Click Searches</h1>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Blog SEO refers to the process of optimizing a blog's content and structure to improve its visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves various techniques such as keyword research, on-page optimization, and link building to attract organic traffic from search engines.</p>
            <p>Zero-click searches, on the other hand, are search queries that are answered directly on the search engine results page itself, without the need for the user to click on any specific search result. These can include featured snippets, knowledge panels, and instant answers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="interactive">
            <button onclick="showResult()">Click me!</button>
            <div class="result" id="result"></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        // JavaScript for interactivity
        function showResult() {
            var resultElement = document.getElementById("result");
            resultElement.textContent = "Congratulations! You've just optimized your blog for SEO and attracted zero-click searches!";
        }
