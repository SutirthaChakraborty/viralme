    <h3>Organic Search</h3>
    <p>Organic search refers to the unpaid, natural, or algorithmic results in a search engine's list of results. It contrasts with paid search (also known as "sponsored results" or "advertising"), where websites pay to have their content appear at the top of search results. Organic search results are determined by a search engine's algorithm based on various factors including relevance, user experience, and authority of the website.</p>

    <h3>B2C</h3>
    <p>B2C stands for "Business to Consumer." It refers to the business model where companies sell products or services directly to consumers. This model is common in retail, e-commerce, and service industries. B2C companies aim to build relationships with individual customers and often focus on personalization, customer service, and convenience.</p>

    <h3>MVP</h3>
    <p>MVP stands for "Minimum Viable Product." In product development, MVP is a version of a new product with the minimum features necessary to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. The goal of MVP is to test the core business idea with a minimum amount of resources. It allows startups and businesses to validate their concept, understand customer needs, and iterate on their product based on feedback.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Imagine a startup developing a new fitness app. Their MVP might include basic features like tracking workouts and setting fitness goals. This version is released to a small group of users for feedback. Based on user responses, the developers can then add more features, such as personalized training plans and community support, to the full product.</p>
