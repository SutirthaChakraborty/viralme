This move is expected to broaden the reach of Microsoft's search engine, Bing, by integrating Skype's search capabilities into the platform. The deal is valued at $8.5 billion.</p>\n    <p>Skype was founded in 2003 and has since become one of the most widely used communication platforms worldwide. With over 400 million users, it offers a range of services including voice and video calls, instant messaging, file sharing, and screen sharing.</p>\n    <p>The acquisition of Skype is part of Microsoft's broader strategy to expand its presence in the cloud computing and communications industries. By integrating Skype's search capabilities into Bing, Microsoft aims to provide users with a more comprehensive search experience that includes both web and voice search results.</p>\n    <p>This move is expected to have a significant impact on the competition between Google and Microsoft in the search and communications industries. Google already has a strong presence in these areas with its Google Voice and Google Hangouts services.
