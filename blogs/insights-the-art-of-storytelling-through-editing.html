    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Storytelling through editing is a powerful way to engage and captivate audiences. It involves the skillful arrangement of visual and auditory elements to convey a compelling narrative.</p>
    <h2>Visual Storytelling</h2>
    <p>Visual texture, illustrations, and scalable vector graphics (SVG) can be used to create a visually stunning narrative that enhances the audience's understanding of the content.</p>
    <h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
    <p>Utilize interactive CSS and JavaScript to create engaging user experiences. For example, parallax scrolling effects and pseudo-classes like :hover can add depth and interactivity to the storytelling process.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      <p>"The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling. None of the effects that you see require JavaScript. ... Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling." - Source [1]</p>
