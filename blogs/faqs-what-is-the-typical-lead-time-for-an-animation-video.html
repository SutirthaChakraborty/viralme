  <div class="question">What is the typical lead time for an animation video?</div>
  <div class="answer">The lead time for an animation video can vary depending on several factors such as the complexity of the animation, the length of the video, and the availability of the artist or team. On average, a simple animation video could take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to complete. However, more complex animations may take months or even years to finish. It's best to discuss your specific needs with your chosen artist or team to get a more accurate estimate of the lead time for your project.</div>

This code creates a simple webpage with a title and an FAQ section. The FAQ section contains a question about the lead time for an animation video and its corresponding answer. The CSS styles are used to format the text and make it more readable. The JavaScript is not included in this code as it is not necessary for this simple example.
