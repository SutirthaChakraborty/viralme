#### Explanation
The provided HTML and CSS code creates a simple 360 product photography viewer. When a user hovers over the product image, it rotates 360 degrees, allowing them to view the product from all angles.

This code utilizes CSS to define the container and image properties, enabling the interactive 360-degree viewing experience. The `perspective` property creates a 3D space for transforming the product image, and the `transform` property enables the rotation effect when the user hovers over the image.

This code snippet is a basic example of how HTML and CSS can be used to implement a 360 product photography viewer on a web page.

For more advanced features and functionalities, additional JavaScript and libraries may be required, depending on the specific requirements of the project.
