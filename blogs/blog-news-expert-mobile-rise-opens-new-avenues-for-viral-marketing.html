    <p>Opening up new avenues for viral marketing through mobile devices has become a trend in recent years. With the rise of smartphones and tablets, businesses have been able to reach their target audiences more effectively than ever before. This has led to an increase in the use of mobile-friendly websites and apps, as well as the development of innovative marketing strategies that leverage the unique features of these devices.</p>
    <p class="highlight">One such strategy is the use of QR codes, which can be easily scanned by users with their mobile devices. By incorporating QR codes into their marketing materials, businesses can provide their customers with a quick and easy way to access information about their products or services. Additionally, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have made it easier than ever for businesses to share news and updates with their followers, especially those who are on the go.</p>
