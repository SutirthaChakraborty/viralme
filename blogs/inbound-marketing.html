CSS (styles.css):

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

header {
    background-color: #007bff;
    color: #fff;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1em 0;
}

section {
    margin: 2em;
}

ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
}

li {
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}

h2 {
    color: #007bff;
}


JavaScript (script.js):

// Interactive code or explanation can be added here using JavaScript
// For example, a simple interactive form for lead generation or a dynamic content loader.


This code includes basic HTML structure, CSS for styling, and the potential for interactive JavaScript to enhance the explanation of inbound marketing.
