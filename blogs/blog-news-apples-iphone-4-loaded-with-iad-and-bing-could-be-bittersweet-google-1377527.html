        <h3>Apple iPhone 4 with IAD and Bing loaded?</h3>
        <p>The latest news is that the upcoming iPhone 4 will be loaded with IAD (iTunes App Store) and Bing search. This could be a bittersweet moment for Google, as it may lose some of its market share to these new features. However, there are also many advantages to this move for Apple, such as increased user convenience and access to more content. It will be interesting to see how this affects the mobile app market in the long run.</p>
