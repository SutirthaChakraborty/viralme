      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 1: Define Your Video's Purpose</h2>
        <p>Start by clarifying the goal and purpose of your video. Decide what message you want to convey and who your target audience is.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 2: Identify Key Scenes</h2>
        <p>Break down your video into key scenes or shots. Think about the sequence of events and how each scene will flow into the next.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 3: Sketch Thumbnails</h2>
        <p>Create rough sketches or thumbnails of each scene. These can be simple drawings that represent the composition and action of each shot.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 4: Add Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Write short descriptions or captions for each scene. This will help you communicate the intended action or dialogue in the video.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 5: Determine Duration</h2>
        <p>Estimate the duration of each scene. This will help you plan the overall length of your video and ensure a smooth flow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 6: Consider Visual Elements</h2>
        <p>Think about the visual elements you want to include in each scene, such as props, locations, or special effects.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 7: Review and Refine</h2>
        <p>Review your storyboard and make any necessary refinements. This is your chance to fine-tune the details before moving to the production phase.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script>
    // JavaScript code for interactive elements
    const steps = document.querySelectorAll('.step');
    steps.forEach((step, index) => {
      step.addEventListener('click', () => {
        step.classList.toggle('active');
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple webpage that outlines the 7 steps for creating a storyboard for a video. It includes CSS styles to format the storyboard container and JavaScript code to add interactivity to the steps. Each step can be clicked to toggle an "active" state. Feel free to customize the CSS styles and add more interactivity as needed.
