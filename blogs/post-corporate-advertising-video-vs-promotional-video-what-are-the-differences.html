In the above HTML code, I have created a basic webpage that explains the differences between post corporate advertising videos and promotional videos. The page includes headings, paragraphs, and a responsive video container using CSS. You can replace the `VIDEO_ID` in the iframe's `src` attribute with the actual video ID from YouTube or any other video hosting platform.

Please note that the code provided is a starting point and can be customized further based on your specific requirements and design preferences.
