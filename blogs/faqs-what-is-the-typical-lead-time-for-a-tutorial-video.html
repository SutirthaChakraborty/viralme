#### Explanation of the HTML Code

The HTML code provided above creates a simple FAQ section with one question and answer. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `<style>` section contains CSS rules to style the FAQ section. It includes styles for the question, answer, and the toggle functionality.
- The `<script>` section contains a JavaScript function `toggleAnswer()` that toggles the visibility of the answer when the question is clicked.
- Inside the `<body>` tag, there is a `<div>` element with the class "faq" that wraps each FAQ item.
- Each FAQ item consists of a question and an answer. The question is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the class "question", and the answer is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the class "answer". The answer is initially hidden using CSS.
- The `onclick` attribute is added to the question element to call the `toggleAnswer()` function and toggle the visibility of the answer.

You can add more FAQs by duplicating the `<div class="faq">` section and modifying the question and answer content accordingly.

Feel free to customize the CSS styles and add more interactivity using JavaScript to enhance the user experience.
