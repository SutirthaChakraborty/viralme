When a user sets DNT, browsers send a \"do not track\" header to websites they visit.</p>\n        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>\n        <p>DNT helps protect users' privacy by preventing companies from collecting and sharing personal information about them without their consent. It also gives users control over how their data is used online.</p>\n        <h2>How can I set it up?</h2>\n        <p>To set up DNT on your browser, follow these steps:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Open your browser's settings or preferences</li>\n            <li>Look for a section called \"Privacy and security\" or \"Privacy\"</li>\n            <li>Find the \"Do Not Track\" option and select it</li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        function showInfo() {\n            document.getElementById('info').style.display = 'block';\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>
