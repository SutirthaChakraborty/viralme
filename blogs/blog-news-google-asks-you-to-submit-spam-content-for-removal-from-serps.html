Here's a small HTML code snippet with CSS that provides information about submitting spam content for removal from search engine results pages (SERPs):

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Submit Spam Content Removal</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background-color: #f2f2f2;
    }
    .container {
      max-width: 600px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 20px;
      background-color: #fff;
      border-radius: 5px;
      box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    }
    h1 {
      color: #333;
      text-align: center;
    }
    p {
      color: #666;
      line-height: 1.5;
    }
    .submit-button {
      display: block;
      width: 200px;
      margin: 20px auto;
      padding: 10px;
      background-color: #007bff;
      color: #fff;
      text-align: center;
      text-decoration: none;
      border-radius: 5px;
    }
    .submit-button:hover {
      background-color: #0056b3;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Submit Spam Content Removal</h1>
    <p>If you have identified spam content that needs to be removed from search engine results pages (SERPs), you can submit a request for removal.</p>
    <p>Follow these steps to submit a spam content removal request:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit the search engine's website.</li>
      <li>Locate the spam content removal page or form.</li>
      <li>Provide the necessary information, including the URL(s) of the spam content.</li>
      <li>Submit the form or request.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once your request is submitted, the search engine will review it and take appropriate action to remove the spam content from the SERPs.</p>
    <a href="#" class="submit-button">Submit Spam Content Removal Request</a>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple webpage with a title, a container for the content, and a button to submit the spam content removal request. The CSS styles the page with a clean and modern look, using a white background, a centered container, and a blue submit button.

Please note that this code is a basic example and may need to be customized to fit your specific needs. Additionally, the functionality to actually submit the request is not included in this code snippet, as it would require server-side processing.

Remember to replace the "#" in the `href` attribute of the submit button with the appropriate URL for the spam content removal page or form.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
