#### Explanation:

- The HTML code creates a basic structure for the blog news section.
- The CSS styles define the appearance of the blog news section, including the background color, font styles, and button styles.
- The `.blog-news` class styles the container for the blog news section.
- The `.spotlight-button` class styles the spotlight button, giving it a background color, text color, padding, and border radius.
- The `:hover` pseudo-class is used to change the background color of the spotlight button when it is hovered over.
