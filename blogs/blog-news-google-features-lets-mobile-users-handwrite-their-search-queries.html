This feature is designed to make it easier for people who prefer typing on a physical keyboard or who have difficulty typing with their fingers to find what they are looking for.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The new feature is available on both Android and iOS devices and can be accessed by opening the Google app on your device and selecting the search bar. Once you have selected the search bar, you will see a small keyboard icon appear at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on this icon will open a virtual keyboard where you can type in your search query using your finger or a physical keyboard.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Google has also announced some other features that are aimed at improving the user experience of its search engine. These include the ability to save frequently used searches, the ability to share search results with others, and the ability to customize the appearance of search results.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Overall, these new features are likely to be well received by users of Google's search engine, particularly those who prefer a more traditional approach to searching. With its focus on making searching easier and more intuitive, Google is continuing to innovate in the world of search technology and is likely to introduce even more exciting features in the future.
