#### Explanation of the HTML Code

- The HTML code starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the opening `<html>` tag.
- The `<head>` section contains the title of the page and the CSS styles.
- Inside the `<body>` section, there is a `<div>` element with the class "container" that acts as a container for the FAQ content.
- The FAQ content consists of a heading `<h1>` and a series of questions and answers.
- Each question is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the class "question", and each answer is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the class "answer".
- You can add more questions and answers by duplicating the question and answer `<div>` elements and modifying the content accordingly.

#### CSS and JavaScript

To make the FAQ page interactive, you can add CSS and JavaScript code to enhance the user experience. Here are some ideas:

- Use CSS transitions or animations to add subtle effects when hovering over questions or expanding/collapsing answers.
- Use JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the answers when clicking on the questions.
- Add event listeners to dynamically load additional content or display tooltips when interacting with certain elements.

Remember to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript code within the `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the HTML file.

Please note that the provided HTML code is a basic starting point, and you can customize it further to match your specific requirements and design preferences.
