        <h2>Don't Write Lousy Headlines: Tips from a Content Marketing Master</h2>
        <p>Creating powerful headlines can be hard work. But **headings** divide different sections of text for your reader. They help structure articles and show readers where to look for certain topics.</p>
        <p>Always aim to develop content that is **useful** to your readers. Research what topics are of interest and what type of content they want.</p>
        <p>Finally, the **headline** is crucial to drawing in readers in the first instance. Make sure you use language that is clear and concise in plain English. While your blog doesn't need to be easily understood by everyone, you do have a target audience. After all, you'll lose readers if you use too much complicated or technical language.</p>
    </section>
</body>

In this HTML code, I've included a simple structure with a header and a section. The CSS styles the header and section to create a visually appealing and readable layout. The section includes tips from a content marketing master about writing powerful headlines and creating useful content for readers. The keywords "headings," "useful," and "headline" have been emphasized in the content to improve reach and relevance.
