In this code, we have created a simple HTML structure for a blog news section. The CSS styles are included within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section. The news content is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the class "news-container". The title, content, and date are styled using CSS classes "news-title", "news-content", and "news-date" respectively.

Feel free to modify the CSS styles and content to suit your needs.
