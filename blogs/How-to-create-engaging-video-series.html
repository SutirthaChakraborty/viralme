#### HTML Code for Interactive Video Series

Here's a basic example of HTML code for creating an interactive and engaging video series using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Interactive Video Series</title>
  <style>
    /* Add your CSS styles here for interactive elements */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Our Interactive Video Series</h1>
  <video controls>
    <source src="video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  <div>
    <button onclick="playChapter(1)">Chapter 1</button>
    <button onclick="playChapter(2)">Chapter 2</button>
    <button onclick="playChapter(3)">Chapter 3</button>
    <!-- Add more buttons for different chapters -->
  </div>
  <script>
    // Add your JavaScript for interactive functionality here
    function playChapter(chapterNumber) {
      // Add logic to play the selected chapter
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code sets up a basic structure for an interactive video series. It includes a video player with controls and buttons for different chapters, which can be customized further with CSS and JavaScript to enhance the interactive experience.

**Key Points:**
- The HTML code includes a video element with controls for playback.
- It also contains buttons for different chapters, which can be used to navigate through the video series.
- The CSS and JavaScript sections are left open for further customization and interactive functionality.

For a more comprehensive and interactive experience, additional CSS and JavaScript can be added to create a visually appealing and engaging video series.
