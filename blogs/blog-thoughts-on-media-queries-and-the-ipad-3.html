#### Explanation of the Code

The HTML code includes a basic structure for a blog page with a header, content section, and footer. It also links to an external CSS file named "styles.css" for styling.

The CSS code demonstrates the use of media queries to apply different styles based on the screen width. In this example, it sets the width of elements to 100% for mobile phones and adjusts the font size for larger screens and iPad devices.

This code showcases the use of media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, including the iPad 3.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this code to further explore media queries and their application to specific devices like the iPad 3.
