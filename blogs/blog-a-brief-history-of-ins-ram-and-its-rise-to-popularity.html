            <h2>History of Instagram</h2>
            <p>Instagram was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. The idea for the app came about when Systrom noticed that people were sharing photos on their smartphones but the quality of the photos was not great. He wanted to create a platform where people could easily edit and share high-quality photos. This led to the development of Instagram, which initially focused on photo sharing and later expanded to include video sharing as well [[1]].</p>
            <p>Instagram was initially available only on iOS devices, but it was later released for Android in April 2012, which further contributed to its rapid growth and popularity [[1]].</p>
