In the above HTML code, I've created a simple page for "Creating a Content Strategy for Ebooks" with interactive CSS and JS to explain the topics. The page includes sections for Introduction, Keyword Research, Gathering Data, and Content Strategy, each accessible through the navigation menu on the left side of the page. This structure allows for easy navigation and understanding of the content related to sustaining company revenue through ebook creation.
