      <h2>Google's New Speed Bump for Mobile Redirects</h2>
      <p>According to the Webmaster Central blog, smartphone searchers will now be informed if they're being redirected to a site's homepage rather than the content they were looking for. This speed bump might not seem like an enormous issue from a webmaster's point of view, but mobile users are notoriously finicky when it comes to page load speed.</p>
      <p>A new Searchmetrics study finds that relevant terms, not just keywords, are correlated with top-ranking website content.</p>
      <p>Matt Cutts has emphasized that redirects are only as good as the purpose they serve. If a page is a helpful substitute for a similar page that's unavailable, the redirect is justified. Otherwise, searchers will quickly bounce away because a website assumed the form (a mobile site) was more important than the function (content).</p>
