Unfortunately, recent changes to Facebook's privacy policies have made it harder for users to browse securely and find relevant news articles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In addition to this issue, social search engines are also becoming less effective due to changes in algorithms and data collection practices. This means that it can be more difficult to find the information you're looking for on social media sites like Facebook.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    However, there are still ways to stay safe and find useful information on social media.

Another way is to follow trusted sources and use social search engines that prioritize accuracy and relevance.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"interactive\">\n    <p>Click here to learn more about how to stay safe on social media!</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n
