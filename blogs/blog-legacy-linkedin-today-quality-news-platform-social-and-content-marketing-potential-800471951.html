#### Interactive CSS and JS Demo: Animated Text Box

\t

Here's an example of how you can use CSS and JavaScript to create an animated text box:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        .animated-text {
            font-size: 24px;
            color: #333;
            background-color: #f9f9f9;
            padding: 10px;
            border-radius: 5px;
            transition: all 0.5s ease;
        }
        .animated-text:hover {
            transform: scale(1.1);
            color: #f60;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 class=\"animated-text\" onclick=\"changeText('Hello World!')\">Click me!</h1>
    <p id=\"text\" class=\"animated-text\" onclick=\"changeText('Another text!')\">Another text!</p>
    <script>
        function changeText(newText) {
            document.getElementById('text').innerHTML = newText;
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

\t
This code creates two text boxes with different colors and hover effects. When you click on one of the boxes, it changes its text and scales down slightly, creating a smooth animation effect.
