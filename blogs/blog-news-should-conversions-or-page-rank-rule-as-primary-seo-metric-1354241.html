  <h1>Conversions or Page Rank Rule as Primary SEO Metric</h1>
  <p>When it comes to measuring the success of your SEO efforts, there are different metrics you can consider. Two important metrics are conversions and page rank.</p>
  
  <h2>Conversions</h2>
  <p>Conversions refer to the desired actions that visitors take on your website, such as making a purchase, filling out a form, or subscribing to a newsletter. By focusing on conversions as the primary SEO metric, you prioritize the impact of your SEO efforts on your business goals. This approach ensures that your website attracts relevant traffic and encourages visitors to take meaningful actions.</p>
  
  <h2>Page Rank</h2>
  <p>Page rank is a metric used by search engines to determine the importance and relevance of a web page. It considers factors like the quality and quantity of backlinks, content relevance, and user engagement. While page rank is an important SEO metric, it should not be the sole focus of your SEO strategy. It is essential to balance page rank with other metrics, such as conversions, to ensure that your website not only ranks well but also drives meaningful results.</p>
  
  <p>By considering both conversions and page rank, you can create a comprehensive SEO strategy that focuses on attracting relevant traffic, optimizing user experience, and achieving your business goals.</p>
  
  <p class="highlight">Remember to use relevant keywords throughout your content to improve reach and visibility.</p>
