#### Explanation:

The HTML code provided above creates a simple webpage with two topics: "Blog Legacy" and "The Flywheel Effect". Each topic is contained within a `<div>` element with the class "topic". The content for each topic is initially hidden and can be toggled by clicking on the "Learn More" button.

The CSS styles defined in the `<style>` tag are used to format the webpage. The header has a dark background color and white text, while the main content area has padding and a light background color. The topics are displayed as headings with accompanying paragraphs. The "Learn More" button and the content associated with each topic are styled accordingly.

The JavaScript function `toggleContent()` is used to show or hide the content for each topic when the corresponding button is clicked. The function checks the current display state of the content and toggles it accordingly.

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS code to suit your needs and add more topics or content as desired.
