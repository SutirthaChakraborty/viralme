In this code snippet, I have included a basic HTML structure with a title, heading, paragraphs, and a list. The CSS styles the elements to make them visually appealing. The key statistics are highlighted using the `.highlight` class, which applies a yellow background color and bold font weight.

Feel free to customize the code further to suit your needs.
