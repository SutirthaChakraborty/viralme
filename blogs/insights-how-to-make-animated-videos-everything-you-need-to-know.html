#### Explanation
The provided HTML and CSS code demonstrates how to create an animated video slide with text using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The keyframes are defined to create a sliding effect for the text, and the animation is applied to the text element within the video slide. This creates an engaging visual effect for the users.

This code leverages CSS animations to enhance the design and create an immersive experience for the viewers. The animation is achieved purely through HTML and CSS, without the need for additional code or media, such as JavaScript or GIFs [[1]](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation-examples).

By incorporating this code, you can effectively showcase information about animated videos in a visually appealing and interactive manner, capturing the attention of your audience and providing valuable insights into the topic.

Feel free to customize the video source, background image, and text content to suit your specific requirements and create a compelling animated video presentation on your website.

For further enhancements, consider utilizing responsive design principles and media queries to adapt the animations to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices [[2]](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/design/cool-javascript-animations/).
