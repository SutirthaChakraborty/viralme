Sure, here's a simple HTML page that includes some basic CSS to style it. The page will also include a JavaScript script to demonstrate the integration of Stumbleupon and Facebook's timeline for sharing content.

        #content {

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            // This is just a simple example of how you might use JavaScript to interact with this page.
            // In a real application, you would likely use more complex methods to handle user interactions and data.
            $('#content').click(function() {
                alert('You clicked on the content!');
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>



In this code, we have used the `$(document).ready()` function to ensure that our JavaScript code doesn't run until the entire page (including images) has loaded. We then use the `$('#content').click()` function to display an alert box when the user clicks on the "content" div. This is just a simple example of how you might use JavaScript to interact with this page. In a real application, you would likely use more complex methods to handle user interactions and data.
