      <h2>Kristen Fritz - Senior Social Media Manager</h2>
      <p>At Brafton, our social media team works so well together they consider themselves a family unit. And with that family dynamic, they're lucky to have a mother figure like Senior Manager Kristen Fritz.</p>
      <p>Kristen joined the Brafton social team at the start of 2011, back when they were still gaining knowledge about the fast-growing industry.</p>
      <p>When bringing on new teammates to such a close-knit group, Kristen said it all comes down to finding someone who will be a good fit for the team as a whole.</p>
      <p>"This sounds incredibly lame, but I love having extra time to organize my emails."</p>
