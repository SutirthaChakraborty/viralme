#### HTML Code for an Infographic: A Guide to Repurposing 5 Different Content Types

Here's a small HTML code snippet that you can use to create an infographic on the topic of repurposing different content types. This code includes CSS and JavaScript to make the infographic interactive and engaging:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Infographic: A Guide to Repurposing 5 Different Content Types</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS styles for the infographic */
    /* Add your own styles here */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Infographic: A Guide to Repurposing 5 Different Content Types</h1>
  
  <div id="content">
    <!-- Add your infographic content here -->
  </div>
  
  <script>
    // JavaScript code for interactivity
    // Add your own JavaScript code here
  </script>
</body>
</html>


Feel free to customize the CSS styles and add your own infographic content within the `<div id="content">` section. You can also add JavaScript code to make the infographic interactive and responsive.

Remember to replace the `<!-- Add your... -->` placeholders with your actual content, such as text, images, and other visual elements.

Please note that this is a basic HTML code structure for an infographic. You can enhance it further by incorporating libraries like D3.js or vis.js, as mentioned in the search results [[1]](https://speckyboy.com/css-javascript-snippets-infographics/).

Good luck with creating your infographic on repurposing content types!
