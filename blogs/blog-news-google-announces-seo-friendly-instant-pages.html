This new feature allows web pages to load instantly when clicked on from search results, providing a seamless browsing experience for users.</p>
    
    <p>According to Google, instant pages are designed to prioritize relevant content and optimize page loading by pre-rendering web pages in the background. This means that when a user clicks on a search result, the page will load almost instantly, reducing the waiting time and improving overall user satisfaction.</p>
    
    <p>Instant pages are particularly beneficial for mobile users, as they help to minimize the latency associated with mobile networks and provide a faster browsing experience. This is in line with Google's ongoing efforts to prioritize mobile-friendly websites and enhance mobile search experiences.</p>
