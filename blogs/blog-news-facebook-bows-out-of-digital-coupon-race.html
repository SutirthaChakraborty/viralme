        Facebook has announced that it will no longer be offering digital coupons to users in the United States. This decision comes after criticism from regulators and consumer groups over the potential for fraud and abuse.

        The social media giant said that it would instead focus on providing more personalized recommendations to users based on their interests and behavior.

        This move is likely to have a significant impact on the digital coupon industry, which has seen increased competition from other players such as Amazon and Google.
