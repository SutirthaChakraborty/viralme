Sure, here is a simple HTML code with CSS that explains the topic of physical web and how it will change digital marketing forever:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Physical Web and Digital Marketing</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
        p {
            color: #666;
        }
        .interactive {
            border: 2px solid #000;
            padding: 20px;
            width: 300px;
            margin: auto;
            text-align: center;
            transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
        }
        .interactive.clicked {
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Physical Web and Digital Marketing</h1>
    <p>The Physical Web refers to the network of physical objects, such as sensors, devices, and vehicles, that are connected to the internet. These objects can communicate with each other and with the internet, creating a network of interconnected devices. This network has the potential to revolutionize digital marketing by providing new ways to reach customers and gather data about their behavior.</p>
    <div class="interactive" onclick="this.classList.toggle('clicked')">Click me to see the effect!</div>
    <script>
        var interactive = document.querySelector('.interactive');
        if (interactive) {
            interactive.addEventListener('click', function() {
                this.classList.toggle('clicked');
            });
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>


This code creates a simple webpage with a title and a paragraph explaining the topic of physical web and digital marketing. It also includes some basic CSS to style the page and a JavaScript event listener to change the background color of the div when it is clicked. The `clicked` class changes the background color of the div to a lighter shade, creating a visual effect that shows how the Physical Web could change digital marketing.
