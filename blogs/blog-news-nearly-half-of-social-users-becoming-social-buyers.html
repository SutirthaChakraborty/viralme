Here's a simple HTML code with CSS and a basic JavaScript that highlights the keywords related to your topic. I've included the keywords in both the content and the HTML tags to improve search engine optimization. The interactive aspect comes from a hover effect on the keywords.

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="keywords" content="blog, news, social users, social buyers, half, reach, purchase, engagement">
  <meta name="description" content="Discover how nearly half of social users are becoming social buyers, driving online purchases through their platforms. Use these keywords to enhance your blog content's discoverability.">
  <style>
    .keyword {
      color: #006BA4;
      font-weight: bold;
      cursor: help; /* Interactive effect on hover */
    }
    
    .keyword:hover {
      text-decoration: underline; /* CSS for hover effect on keywords */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Blog News: Half of Social Users Embracing Social Buying</h1>
  
  <p>According to the latest trends, <span class="keyword">social users</span> are increasingly <span class="keyword">converting into social buyers</span>. As these trends surge, understanding <span class="keyword">engagement</span> on platforms and optimizing your content for <span class="keyword">purchase</span> keywords can significantly <span class="keyword">boost reach</span> and attract more online shoppers.</p>

  <p>Stay updated on how this shift is reshaping the <span class="keyword">e-commerce</span> landscape and incorporate relevant best practices in your <span class="keyword">blog posts</span> for maximum impact.</p>
  
  <script>
    // Simple JavaScript to show an alert on keyword hover
    document.querySelectorAll('.keyword').forEach(function(keyword) {
      keyword.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
        alert(`Click the keyword "${keyword.innerText}" for more insights.`);
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>


This code creates a simple webpage with an HTML title, header, and two paragraphs discussing the topic. The keywords are highlighted in blue, and a hover effect underlines them. The JavaScript adds a basic alert for a more interactive experience when the keywords are hovered over.
