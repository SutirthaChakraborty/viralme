This is because people are more likely to open and engage with emails during this time compared to other times of the day. In fact, studies show that email open rates increase by up to 21% in the morning!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        So if you want to maximize your reach and engagement, consider sending your blog news and updates in the early morning. Not only will your audience be more receptive, but they will also have more time to read and respond to your content.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        To make sure your emails stand out in a crowded inbox, use interactive CSS and JavaScript elements. For example, you could add a \"highlight\" class to important information or use animations to draw attention to key points.\n    </p>\n</body>\n</html>
