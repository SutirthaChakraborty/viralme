#### Interactive CSS and JS Explanation
To explain the topics of mobile marketing and the importance of mobile-friendly strategies, interactive CSS and JS can be used to create engaging visual elements and animations on the webpage. For example, CSS animations can be employed to demonstrate the transition from a non-mobile-friendly layout to a responsive, mobile-optimized design. Additionally, JavaScript can be utilized to showcase interactive features such as mobile menu toggles and dynamic content loading based on different screen sizes.
