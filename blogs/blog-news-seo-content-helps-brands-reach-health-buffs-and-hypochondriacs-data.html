- The key to getting a higher organic page rank for more of your desired keywords and phrases lies in proper internal linking and good site architecture using something called siloing [[1]](https://healthcaresuccess.com/blog/healthcare-marketing/healthcare-seo-guide.html).
- By using relevant tags like <title>, <meta>, and <alt>, you help search engines understand the topic and purpose of your content [[2]](https://www.semrush.com/blog/html-tags-for-seo/).
- The <meta name="description"> attribute is what search engine crawlers reference when they index your page, so it's vital to your SEO health [[3]](https://kinsta.com/blog/html-best-practices/).
- You can increase search engine rankings by adding visual content to your site and elsewhere, while textual content serves the purpose of organically combining keywords and producing more content to rank [[4]](https://www.lumar.io/blog/best-practice/seo-strategies-for-healthcare-and-wellness-websites/).
