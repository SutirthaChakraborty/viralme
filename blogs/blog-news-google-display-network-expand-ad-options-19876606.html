In this code snippet, I have included a basic HTML structure with CSS styling. The content is wrapped in a `<div>` with the class "content" to give it a clean and centered appearance. The text is styled with appropriate colors and fonts, and there is a centered image to visually enhance the blog post.

Feel free to customize the code further to fit your specific needs and design preferences. Remember to replace the image source (`ad-options.jpg`) with your own image file.

By using this HTML code, you can create an engaging blog post about expanding ad options on the Google Display Network.
