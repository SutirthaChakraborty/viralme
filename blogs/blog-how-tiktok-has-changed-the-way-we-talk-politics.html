    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      **TikTok**, the popular short video platform, has significantly impacted the way people engage in political discourse. Its unique format and wide reach have transformed the dynamics of political conversations.
    </p>
    <h2>TikTok Videos on Political Issues</h2>
    <div class="video-container">
      <iframe src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/123456789" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
      The platform has provided a space for individuals to express their political views through engaging and concise videos, reaching a diverse audience.
    </p>
    <h2>Impact on Political Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      TikTok has played a pivotal role in raising awareness about various political issues, effectively educating and informing its users.

In the provided HTML code, I've created a simple webpage discussing the impact of TikTok on political discourse. The page includes a header, an introduction section, a section for embedding a TikTok video related to politics, and a section highlighting the platform's impact on political awareness. The CSS styles are used to format the page, including the header, text, and video container.

Please note that the actual TikTok video URL (https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/123456789) should be replaced with the specific video embed URL related to the topic of politics and TikTok.

This code provides a basic structure for a blog post discussing how TikTok has changed the way we talk about politics, and it can be further enhanced with additional content, styling, and interactivity based on specific requirements.
