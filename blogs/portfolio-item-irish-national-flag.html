#### HTML Code for Portfolio Item: Irish National Flag

Here is a small HTML code snippet that you can use to create a portfolio item for the Irish national flag:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Irish National Flag</title>
    <style>
        .irishflag {
            box-shadow: 90px 0 #169B62 inset, -90px 0 #FF883E inset;
            width: 270px;
            height: 135px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Irish National Flag</h1>
    <div class="irishflag"></div>
    <p>The Irish national flag consists of three vertical stripes of equal width. The colors of the flag are green, white, and orange. The green stripe represents the Gaelic tradition of Ireland, the orange stripe represents the Protestant tradition, and the white stripe represents peace between the two traditions.</p>
</body>
</html>


In this code, we define a CSS class called "irishflag" that sets the box-shadow property to create the vertical stripes of the flag. The width and height of the flag are also specified. The HTML structure includes a heading, a div element with the "irishflag" class, and a paragraph describing the flag.

Feel free to customize the code according to your needs and design preferences. You can add more content, images, or interactive elements to enhance the portfolio item.

Remember to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your project, as mentioned in the search results.
