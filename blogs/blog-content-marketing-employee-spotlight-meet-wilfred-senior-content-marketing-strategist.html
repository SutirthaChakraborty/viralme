        <p>I started my personal blog Content.Support as a way to learn how to become a better writer while forcing myself to learn more about content marketing, Wilfred said. I also am a marketing mentor with MassChallenge, a very well know startup accelerator program, helping startups build their services and products. Wilfred's strength as a strategist (and similarly as a DJ) is that he's constantly thinking about the audience.</p>
