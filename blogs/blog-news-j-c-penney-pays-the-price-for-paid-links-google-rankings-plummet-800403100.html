    <h2>Investigation Against J.C. Penney</h2>
    <p>Over the weekend, The New York Times published an article about a search engine optimization investigation against J.C. Penney that has resulted in the department store's quick sink in Google search results.</p>
    <p>J.C. Penney spokesperson Darcie Brossart claims that the company did not authorize, and we were not involved with or aware of, the posting of the links that The New York Times sent to us, as it is against our natural search policies, Google execs seem to feel the department store is still responsible.</p>
    <p>Google claims its algorithm caught on, as J.C. Penney dropped from the top slots for many key phrases earlier last week, but Matt Cutts says his company took it a step farther and manually removed J.C. Penney from the top search results as well. In an interview with The Times, Cutts said he can confirm that this linking scheme violates our guidelines.</p>
