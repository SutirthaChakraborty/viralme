    <p>Social Reputability for SEO, Traffic Cannibalization, and the Promise of Transparency from Google</p>
  </header>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Social Reputability for SEO</h2>
    <p>According to Matt Cutts, Google can only use social signals from Open Graph sources. It can't crawl Facebook pages to determine reputability or real-world impact as a brand has on those platforms [[1]].</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Traffic Cannibalization</h2>
    <p>Matt Cutts emphasized the importance of focusing on quality content for good SEO. Traffic cannibalization can occur when multiple pages on a website compete for the same keywords, resulting in a decrease in overall traffic. To avoid this, it's crucial to create unique and valuable content for each page [[1]].</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Promise of Transparency from Google</h2>
    <p>While Google aims to provide transparency to webmasters, it won't be giving specific information about its algorithms. However, Google is focusing on transparency in terms of providing quality search results and indexing billions of pages per day [[1]].</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple webpage with a header section that includes the title and a brief description of the topic. The content is divided into three sections: "Social Reputability for SEO," "Traffic Cannibalization," and "The Promise of Transparency from Google." Each section includes a heading and a paragraph with information taken from the search results.

The CSS styles the webpage, providing a clean and readable layout. The header has a white background with black text, and the sections have a light gray background with appropriate margins and padding for readability.

Feel free to modify the code and add more sections or information as needed.
