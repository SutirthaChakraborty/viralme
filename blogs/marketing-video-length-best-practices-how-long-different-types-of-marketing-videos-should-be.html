        <h1>Marketing Video Length Best Practices</h1>
        <p>When it comes to marketing videos, the length can greatly impact their effectiveness. Here are some best practices for different types of marketing videos:</p>
        
        <h2>Explainer Videos</h2>
        <p>Explainer videos should be concise and to the point. Aim for a length of **30 to 90 seconds** to effectively communicate your message and keep viewers engaged.</p>
        
        <h2>Product Demo Videos</h2>
        <p>Product demo videos should provide a comprehensive overview of your product's features and benefits. Keep these videos between **1 to 3 minutes** to maintain viewer interest and showcase the key aspects of your product.</p>
        
        <h2>Testimonial Videos</h2>
        <p>Testimonial videos should be relatively short and focused. Limit them to **1 to 2 minutes** to highlight customer experiences and build trust with your audience.</p>
        
        <h2>Brand Story Videos</h2>
        <p>Brand story videos allow you to connect with your audience emotionally. These videos can range from **2 to 5 minutes** in length, giving you enough time to tell a compelling narrative and create a lasting impression.</p>
