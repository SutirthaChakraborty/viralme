    <p>With roughly six years at Brafton, Dave Snyder is a veritable old-timer, watching our business mature from a digital media upstart to a formidable content marketing leader. That experience has paid off handsomely not just for Dave, but for all of Brafton.</p>
    
    <p>That knack for pleasing demanding clients and surpassing challenging SME expectations gave Dave a reputation as a fixer of sorts. Everyone knew, you had a rocky account in dire need of a course correction, you bring in Snyder.</p>
    
    <p>Dave knew at an early age what he wanted to do in life: write. That passion for the written word led Dave to major in English at NYU before pursuing an MFA in Creative Writing at Bostons Emerson College.</p>
    
    <p>He started out (as many of us do) as a News & Content Writer, quickly earning praise from colleagues and clients alike for his sharp prose and ability to handle difficult subject matters and discerning editorial eyes. It wasnt long before Dave transitioned to a Senior Writer role on the Business & Technology team.</p>
