    <h1>Impact of Video on Social Media Engagement Rates</h1>
    <p>Video content on social media has a significant impact on engagement rates. Studies show that videos receive higher interaction and share rates compared to text or image posts. Users are more likely to engage with video content due to its visual appeal and storytelling capabilities.</p>
