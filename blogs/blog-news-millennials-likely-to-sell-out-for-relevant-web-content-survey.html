Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs. Remember to replace the content within the `<title>` and `<h1>` tags with your own relevant information.

The CSS styles provided in the code will give the page a clean and modern look. You can further customize the styles to match your desired design.

Please note that this is a basic HTML code snippet and does not include any interactive JavaScript functionality. If you want to add interactivity to the survey form or other elements on the page, you can include additional JavaScript code as needed.

Remember to optimize your code for search engines by using relevant keywords in your HTML tags and content. This will help improve the reach and visibility of your blog news page.

Good luck with your project!
