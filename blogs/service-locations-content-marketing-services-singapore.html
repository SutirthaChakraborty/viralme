In the HTML code above, I've created a simple webpage that showcases the service locations for content marketing services in Singapore. The page consists of a header, which provides the title of the webpage, and a section that contains information about different service locations. Each location is displayed in a separate container with a heading and a brief description. The CSS styles the webpage, including the background color, font, and layout, to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the content.

Feel free to further customize the HTML and CSS to suit your specific needs and branding requirements. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
