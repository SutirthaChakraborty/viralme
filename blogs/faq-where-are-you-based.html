Here's a small HTML code snippet with CSS that you can use to create an FAQ section on your website:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>FAQ</title>
    <style>
        .question {
            font-weight: bold;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        
        .answer {
            display: none;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }
        
        .question.active {
            color: blue;
        }
        
        .question.active + .answer {
            display: block;
        }
    </style>
    <script>
        function toggleAnswer(event) {
            const question = event.target;
            question.classList.toggle("active");
        }
        
        const questions = document.querySelectorAll(".question");
        questions.forEach(question => {
            question.addEventListener("click", toggleAnswer);
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
    <div class="question">Where are you based?</div>
    <div class="answer">We are based in [Your Location].</div>
    
    <!-- Add more questions and answers here -->
    
</body>
</html>


This code creates a simple FAQ section with collapsible questions and answers. When a question is clicked, the corresponding answer is displayed or hidden. The CSS styles the questions to make them bold and adds a cursor pointer to indicate interactivity. The JavaScript code adds an event listener to each question, toggling the "active" class when clicked, which controls the display of the answer.

Feel free to customize the code and add more questions and answers as needed. Remember to replace `[Your Location]` with the actual location where your company is based.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
