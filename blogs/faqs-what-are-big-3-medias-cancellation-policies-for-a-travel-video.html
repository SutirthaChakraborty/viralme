In the provided HTML code, I have included sections for both FAQs and Travel Video Cancellation Policies. The FAQs section contains questions and answers, each wrapped in a div with appropriate classes for styling. The Travel Video Cancellation Policies section includes different policies with their respective details, also wrapped in divs with specific classes for styling.

The CSS includes styles for the FAQs and the Travel Video Cancellation Policies, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly presentation of the information. Additionally, I've included JavaScript to enable an interactive feature for the FAQs, allowing users to click on a question to reveal its answer.

This code provides a basic structure for displaying FAQs and Travel Video Cancellation Policies on a web page, with interactive CSS and JavaScript to enhance the user experience.
