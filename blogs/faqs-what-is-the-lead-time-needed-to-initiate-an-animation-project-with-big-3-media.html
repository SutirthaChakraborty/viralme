This HTML code creates a basic structure for an FAQ section. It includes a container for the FAQs, each with a question and an answer. The CSS styles define the appearance of the FAQ section, including font styles, margins, and padding.

Feel free to add more FAQ items by duplicating the `<div class="faq-item">` section and modifying the question and answer content.

Remember to customize the content of the FAQs to provide relevant information about animation projects with Big 3 Media.

Please note that this is a basic starting point, and you can further enhance the design and functionality using additional CSS and JavaScript as needed.
