    <h2>Google Adds Enhanced Click Type Report to AdWords</h2>
    <p>Google has recently announced an update to its AdWords platform, introducing a new feature that allows advertisers to measure ad interaction more effectively. The new Click Type Report is designed to provide deeper insights into how users engage with ads, enabling advertisers to better understand and optimize their campaigns.</p>
    <p>This feature is particularly useful for advertisers looking to gain more granular insights into user behavior, such as distinguishing between clicks from organic search results and those from paid ads. This can help advertisers fine-tune their strategies to improve ad performance.</p>
    <p>To access the Click Type Report, advertisers can navigate to the Performance Reports section within their AdWords account and select the new report from the available options. The report will provide detailed information on the type of clicks, including organic, paid, and other types of traffic, helping advertisers make informed decisions about their ad spend and targeting strategies.</p>
