    <h1>Blog News: Law Firms Consider QR Marketing but Must Ramp Up Mobile Websites</h1>
    <p>
      QR marketing has become a popular tool for law firms to promote their brand and services. However, law firms must also ramp up their mobile websites to ensure they are accessible to all potential clients on different devices.

      Law firms that fail to do so risk losing out on potential clients who rely heavily on their mobile devices for information gathering. In addition, failing to have a mobile website can also damage the firm's reputation and credibility.
