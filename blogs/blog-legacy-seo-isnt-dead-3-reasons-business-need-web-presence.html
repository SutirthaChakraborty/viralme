In the above HTML and CSS code, I've created a simple webpage titled "Blog Legacy: SEO Isn't Dead" with a section highlighting "3 Reasons Why Business Needs Web Presence." The webpage includes a header, a section for the reasons, and some basic styling to enhance the visual appeal. The reasons for the importance of web presence are emphasized, and a specific section is dedicated to the relationship between SEO and web presence, emphasizing the importance of implementing SEO strategies for maximizing the benefits of having an online presence [[1]](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/build-a-website-using-html-css).

This code provides a foundation for a webpage discussing the importance of web presence for businesses and the role of SEO in maximizing its benefits.
