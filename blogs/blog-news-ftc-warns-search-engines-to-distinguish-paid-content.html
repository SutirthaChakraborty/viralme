#### Explanation:
The provided HTML code creates a simple webpage to convey the news about the FTC warning search engines to distinguish paid content. The page includes a header, a section for the FTC guidelines, and a button to learn more. The CSS styles the page with a dark background for the header and a light background for the content section. The JavaScript function attached to the button triggers an alert to emphasize the importance of distinguishing paid content for transparency and user trust.

This code uses relevant keywords such as "FTC," "search engines," "paid content," and "advertising guidelines" to enhance its reach and relevance to the topic.
