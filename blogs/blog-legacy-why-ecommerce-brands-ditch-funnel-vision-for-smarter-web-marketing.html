      <h2>Why Ecommerce Brands Ditch Funnel Vision for Smarter Web Marketing</h2>
      <p>Ecommerce site owners should produce blog content, offering how-to tips, current trends, and advice about how to get the most out of a given item, and place links to those resources on each product page. This ideology might actually shorten the sales cycle, as those people close to buying might need just a subtle nudge, and persuasive and informational FREE blog posts may be the key.</p>
      <p>Understanding digital trends and knowing how to manipulate the sales cycle for higher profit margins is a must. Brands have begun to funnel additional resources toward internet marketing to develop stronger ecommerce hubs and promotional tactics to support their websites.</p>
      <p>The sales cycle or funnel isn't fluid or linear anymore. It's convoluted and looks more like a pretzel than anything else.</p>
