    <h1>Twitter Announces Proprietary Link Shortener</h1>
    <p>Twitter has recently announced its own link shortener as a response to malicious URLs. This new service will scan the real destination of shortened links for malicious content, providing an extra layer of security for users.</p>
    <p>As cyber criminals take advantage of popular link condensing services like Bitly and is.gd to disguise their malicious content, Twitter has taken action to protect its users. Unlike most independent link condensing services, Twitter's link shortener will automatically apply the service to any links contained in direct messages or emails.</p>
    <p>If you're an active Twitter user, this new link shortener will help ensure that the links you encounter on the platform are safe and trustworthy.</p>
