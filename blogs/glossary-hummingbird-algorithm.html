It is commonly used for quick lookups and data retrieval. The most common types of hash functions are the modulo hash function and the polynomial hash function.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"min-heap\">Min Heap</h2>\n    <p>A min heap is a complete binary tree where each node has a value less than or equal to its children. The root of the min heap is always the minimum value in the entire tree. Min heaps are commonly used in priority queue algorithms such as the heap sort algorithm.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"priority_queue\">Priority Queue</h2>\n    <p>A priority queue is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements with some priority associated with each element. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority. The most common types of priority queues are the max heap and the min heap.</p>\n</body>\n</html>
