        <h1>Content Marketing Weekly</h1>
        <p>If that means one blog post a week, that's fine. If it means once every two weeks, run with it. It really comes down to a time-in time-out equation. Identify your niche, capitalize on low-hanging search opportunities and dedicate yourself to consistent, quality content. Your strategy can become more sophisticated once you're established - right now, you just need a foot in the door.</p>
        <p>The Content Marketing Weekly explores the latest industry insights you need to know. This week, we feature the art of headline writing, the travesty of bad content, and the benefits of going big with your content - even if you're small.</p>
        <p>Not seeing the return you want from your <span class="highlight">#ContentMarketing</span> efforts?</p>

In this code snippet, I have created a simple HTML page with a container div that holds the content related to the blog. The CSS styles are applied to format the page and make it visually appealing. The key points from the information provided have been highlighted using the `.highlight` class in the CSS.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you can further customize the code and add more elements as per your requirements.
