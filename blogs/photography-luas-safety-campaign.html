This HTML code creates a simple webpage for the Photography Luas Safety Campaign. It includes a header section with the campaign title, a main section with information about the campaign and a gallery of photographs, and a footer section with contact details.

The CSS styles in the `<style>` tag provide a basic design for the page, including a dark header and footer, a centered gallery with images, and a clean overall layout.

Feel free to customize the code and add more images to the gallery section as needed. Remember to replace the image URLs with the actual image file paths or URLs.

Please note that this is a basic HTML code snippet and does not include any interactive CSS or JS elements. If you would like to add interactivity or more advanced features to the website, additional coding and scripting may be required.

I hope this helps you get started with your Photography Luas Safety Campaign website!
