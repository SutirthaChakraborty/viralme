    <h1>Blog Legacy SEO Strategies: Mobile vs Desktop</h1>
    <p>When it comes to optimizing your blog for search engines, it's important to consider the differences between mobile and desktop search. Here are some strategies to keep in mind:</p>

    <h2>1. Keyword Research</h2>
    <p>Perform thorough keyword research to identify the words and phrases that users are searching for. Use tools like Google's Keyword Planner or SEMRush to find relevant keywords with high search volume. **Long-tail keywords** can be particularly effective in attracting conversion-ready traffic.</p>

    <h2>2. URL Structure</h2>
    <p>Include keywords in your URLs to make them more user-friendly and relevant to search engines. Organize your content using directories or folders to group similar topics, as this can help search engines understand the structure of your site and how often individual URLs change.</p>

    <h2>3. HTML Tags</h2>
    <p>Use HTML tags strategically to optimize your content for search engines. Some important tags include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong>: Use descriptive and keyword-rich titles for each page or piece of content on your blog.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;meta&gt;</strong>: Include relevant meta tags, such as meta descriptions, to provide concise summaries of your content.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> to &lt;h6&gt;: Use header tags to organize your content and indicate its importance to search engines.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;b&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong>: Use these tags to make text bold, with the latter indicating greater importance.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;i&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong>: Use these tags for italicized text, with the latter providing semantic emphasis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Content Optimization</h2>
    <p>Naturally incorporate keywords and keyphrases into your blog posts to send positive signals to search engines and let readers know they're in the right place. Aim for a keyword density of around 1-2% of the total text on a page. However, it's important to research which keywords will work best for your specific business.</p>
    <p>[[3]]</p>

    <h2>5. Responsive Web Design</h2>
    <p>Ensure your blog is mobile-friendly by implementing responsive web design. This approach uses HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge your website to make it look good on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and phones.</p>
    <p>[[10]]</p>

    <h2>6. Analyze and Adapt</h2>
    <p>Regularly monitor and analyze the performance of your blog's SEO efforts using analytics tools. This will help you identify whether your strategies are successful and make necessary adjustments to improve your search rankings.</p>
