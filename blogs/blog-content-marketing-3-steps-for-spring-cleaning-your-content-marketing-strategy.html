        <p>In this step, you'll need to take a close look at your current content marketing strategy and identify areas that need improvement. This could include analyzing your website traffic, social media engagement, and search engine rankings. You may also want to consider conducting a content audit to see what types of content are resonating with your audience and which ones aren't.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Repurpose Old Content</h2>
      <div class=\"step">
        <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Repurpose Image\">
        <p>Once you've identified areas for improvement, it's time to start repurposing old content. This could mean updating old blog posts, creating new content based on existing material, or even republishing content in a different format (e.g. video, infographic). By reusing existing content, you can save time and resources while still providing value to your audience.</p>

        <p>Finally, as you begin implementing these changes, it's important to focus on quality and consistency. This means ensuring that all of your content is well-written, visually appealing, and relevant to your target audience. It also means maintaining a consistent posting schedule so that your audience knows when to expect new content from you. By focusing on quality and consistency, you can build trust with your readers and establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry.</p>
