They capture images and videos that are later used to create a final product. There are various types of cameras available in the market, such as DSLR, mirrorless, and point-and-shoot cameras. Each type has its own set of features and benefits.</p>\n                <h2>Lenses</h2>\n                <p>Lenses are used to focus the light onto the camera sensor or film. They come in different shapes, sizes, and focal lengths, allowing you to adjust the depth of field and perspective of your shots. Some popular lens types include wide-angle, zoom, and macro lenses.</p>\n                <h2>Tripods</h2>\n                <p>Tripods are essential for stabilizing your camera during long exposures or when shooting in low light conditions. They come in different materials, such as aluminum, carbon fiber, and plastic, and can be adjusted for height and angle.</p>\n                <h2>Flashes</h2>\n                <p>Flashes are used to add light to your photos or videos in situations where natural light is not sufficient. They come in different modes, such as manual, automatic, and red-eye reduction, and can be attached to the camera or mounted on a tripod.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>
