        <h2>Importance of SEO for Blogs</h2>
        <p>**In today's SEO, links are vital—especially to your own content. Think of it as a vote for articles. Just make sure you're linking to content that supports and expands the article. Linking out to something that isn't relevant to your topic can result in search penalties.**</p>
        <p>It's best if you use your keyword in the title as well as the meta description tag. It improves how search engines list your content.</p>
        <p>**Useful Keywords:** SEO, meta description, links, search penalties, keyword usage</p>

        <p>**While you could boost traffic to your site by placing advertisements on social networks and the search engine results page (SERP) of search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, all of those traffic sources will cost you money—a resource which may not be plentiful when you are first getting started.**</p>
        <p>**Useful Keywords:** Free traffic sources, search engine results page, social networks, boosting traffic</p>
