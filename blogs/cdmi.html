        <h1>CDMI (Cloud Data Management Interface)</h1>
        <p>CDMI is a standard that defines the interface for accessing and managing data stored in cloud storage systems. It provides a unified way to interact with different cloud storage providers, allowing users to perform operations such as creating containers, uploading and downloading files, and managing metadata.</p>
        <p>With CDMI, developers can build applications that are compatible with multiple cloud storage providers without having to write separate code for each provider's API.</p>
        <p>CDMI supports features like data encryption, access control, and data lifecycle management, making it a comprehensive solution for managing data in the cloud.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple webpage with a centered heading and paragraphs of text that provide information about CDMI. The CSS styles the page with a clean and modern look, including a white background, a container with a maximum width of 600px, and a subtle box shadow.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different CSS styles to customize the appearance of the webpage.
