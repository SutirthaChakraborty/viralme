In this code, I've included interactive CSS to style the HTML elements. The background color is set to a light gray (#f2f2f2), and the text is styled using the Arial font. The content is wrapped in a `<body>` tag, and the main heading is displayed using an `<h1>` tag. The paragraphs are styled using `<p>` tags, and important keywords are highlighted using the `.highlight` class.

Please note that this is a basic HTML code snippet, and you can further customize it based on your specific requirements.
