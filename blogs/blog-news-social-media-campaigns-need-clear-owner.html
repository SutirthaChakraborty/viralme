This means that there should be one person or team responsible for managing the campaign, setting goals and objectives, creating content, and monitoring performance. Without a clear owner, it can be difficult to ensure that the campaign is reaching its full potential and that all relevant metrics are being tracked and analyzed.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>
