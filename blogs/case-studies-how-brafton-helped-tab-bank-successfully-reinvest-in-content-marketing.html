        <h1>Brafton Case Study: TAB Bank's Content Marketing Reinvestment</h1>
        <p>Delivering eBooks, white papers, case studies, and infographics that surpassed expectations laid the groundwork for reinvestment in content marketing and superior prospecting at TAB Bank.</p>
        <p>Trevor and Marketing Manager Shane Adair pivoted away from an ABM model and signed on with Brafton to pursue immediate content wins. They needed rich, informative assets that could be leveraged on the website, on social, and through email. Combining the minds of some of Brafton's top writers and designers, we produced a number of eBooks, white papers, case studies, and infographics over a three-month period.</p>
        <p>One of the core challenges TAB Bank ran into was creating a library of content that could serve many purposes. Without fresh content, the website was lacking an authoritative resource center that could spearhead inbound marketing and lead-gen efforts.</p>
        <p>This marketing evolution should enable TAB Bank to build upon their current success and bring in more leads.</p>
