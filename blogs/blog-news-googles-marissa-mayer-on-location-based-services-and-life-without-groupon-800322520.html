            <p class="post-date">Published on August 11, 2024</p>
            <p class="post-content">Brafton has reported that Google officials say local is the search company's top priority, and Media Bistro's recent interview with Marissa Mayer, vice president of consumer products, confirms that Google's failure to acquire Groupon hasn't ended its interest in the local market. When asked about the slow adoption of location-based services, Mayer shrugged off some experts' doubts about geosocial platforms. "It's really early," she said. "We are still experimenting with [the incentives]. She says Google wants to unlock all of this potential. One way the company might have unlocked incentives for local search was through a partnership with Groupon."</p>
