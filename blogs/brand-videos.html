    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
            margin: 0;

        }

            box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        }
        
        h1 {
            color: #333;
            text-align: center;
        }

            line-height: 1.5;
        }
        
        .video {
            position: relative;
            padding-bottom: 56.25%;
            height: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
        
        .video iframe {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;

            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Brand Videos</h1>
        <p>Brand videos are an effective way for companies to showcase their products, services, and brand identity. They can be used for marketing, advertising, and building brand awareness.</p>
        
        <div class="video">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>By creating compelling brand videos, companies can engage their target audience, tell their brand story, and differentiate themselves from competitors.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a webpage with a container for the content, including a heading, paragraph, and a video section. The CSS styles the webpage with a clean and modern look, including a centered container, a responsive video section, and a pleasant color scheme.

Feel free to replace the `VIDEO_ID` in the `<iframe>` tag with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed.

Remember to customize the content and design according to your specific needs and preferences.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
