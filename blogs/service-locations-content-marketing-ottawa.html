#### Explanation:

The HTML code provided above creates a simple webpage that displays information about service locations for content marketing in Ottawa. The CSS styles are included within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

The webpage is structured using HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>`. The content is organized into two sections: one for Ottawa and another for other locations. Each section contains a heading and paragraphs of text.

The CSS styles define the appearance of the webpage. The `body` element sets the background color and font family. The `.container` class sets the maximum width, margin, padding, background color, and box shadow for the main content container. The heading and paragraph styles define the font size, color, and margin for the text. The `.location` class sets the margin for each location section.
