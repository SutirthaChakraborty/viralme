This HTML code creates a basic structure for your blog page. It includes a header with the title "Content Marketing Weekly," a main content section with some sample text, and a call-to-action button at the end. The CSS styles define the layout, colors, and typography for the page.

Feel free to customize the code according to your specific needs and design preferences. Remember to replace the "#" in the anchor tag with the actual URL of your blog post.
