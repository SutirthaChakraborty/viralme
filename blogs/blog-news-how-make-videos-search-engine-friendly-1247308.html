This will help search engines understand what your video is about and make it more likely to show up in search results for those keywords.</p>\n    \n    <p class=\"highlight\">Video Tags</p>\n    \n    <p>Tags are metadata within your video that help search engines categorize and rank it. Using relevant tags in your video's metadata can help improve its search engine ranking.
