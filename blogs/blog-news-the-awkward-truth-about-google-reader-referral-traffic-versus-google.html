      <h1>The Awkward Truth About Google Reader Referral Traffic versus Google</h1>
      <p>
        As a former user of Google Reader, I was disappointed when it shut down in 2013. However, the real issue with Google Reader was not its shutdown but rather the fact that it relied heavily on referral traffic from other sites to drive traffic to itself. This meant that if those sites stopped linking to Google Reader, its traffic would plummet.
