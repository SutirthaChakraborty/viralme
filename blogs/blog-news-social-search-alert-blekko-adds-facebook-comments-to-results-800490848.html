    <h1>Blekko Adds Facebook Comments to Results</h1>
    <p>According to a search result snippet from Search Engine People, Blekko is a search engine that offers added value through its 'slashtags', which are filters that limit search results to predefined websites or domains. Blekko has recently added Facebook comments to its search results, allowing users to engage with the content and share their thoughts.</p>
    
    <div class="comments">
      <div class="comment">
        <div class="author">John Doe</div>
        <div class="date">August 9, 2024</div>
        <div class="content">I found the Facebook comments feature on Blekko very useful. It's great to see what others have to say about the search results.</div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="comment">
        <div class="author">Jane Smith</div>
        <div class="date">August 10, 2024</div>
        <div class="content">I love how Blekko is integrating social media into their search results. It adds a whole new level of interaction.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple webpage with a heading, a paragraph explaining Blekko's addition of Facebook comments to its search results, and a section for user comments. The CSS styles the page to make it visually appealing, and the interactive comments section allows users to see and engage with the comments.

Please note that this code is a basic example and may need further customization to fit your specific needs.
