In fact, businesses that increased their social media presence by just 1% saw a 4% increase in website traffic and a 20% increase in sales.</p>\n        <p>One of the key findings of the study was that small businesses that focused on creating engaging content and building relationships with their followers were more successful than those that simply posted promotional content.
