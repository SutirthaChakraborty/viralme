    <h1>7 Killer Tips for Logo Design that Work</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tip #1</strong>: Keep it simple and clean. A cluttered logo can be overwhelming and difficult to remember.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip #2</strong>: Use a strong color palette. Choose colors that are easy to read and have a positive impact on your brand image.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip #3</strong>: Make sure your logo is scalable. It should look great at any size, from small business cards to large billboards.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip #4</strong>: Consider using negative space. A well-designed logo with plenty of white space can make it stand out and look more professional.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip #5</strong>: Avoid using too many fonts or symbols in your logo. Stick to one or two key elements that represent your brand identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip #6</strong>: Test your logo with different audiences and devices. Make sure it looks good on both desktop and mobile screens, and in different lighting conditions.</li>
        <li class=\"highlight\"><strong>Tip #7</strong>: Don't be afraid to get creative! Experiment with different shapes, textures, and styles to find the perfect fit for your brand.</li>
