    <h1>Blog Content Marketing</h1>
    <p>Content marketing is a powerful strategy for HR marketing, but it's important to avoid common pitfalls. Here are three common HR marketing pitfalls that can be solved by creative custom content marketing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lack of fresh topics: Many companies recognize the importance of content but struggle to generate new and engaging topics. One solution is to deliver information in a surprising and unexpected way, breathing new life into stale topics [[1]].</li>
      <li>Not defining the value of a conversion: To map content marketing strategies to long-term financial benefits, it's crucial to define the value of a conversion specific to your business. Creating a custom unit through which you can extrapolate value can help achieve this [[1]].</li>
      <li>Focusing solely on number of clients and ROI: While it may be tempting to aim exclusively for the number of clients and return on investment (ROI), it's important to consider the long-term benefits of content marketing. By delivering valuable and engaging content, you can build brand authority and attract quality clients [[1]].</li>
