    <h1>Study: 60% of Companies Struggle to Measure the ROI of Their Social Media Marketing</h1>
    <p>Virtually every brand has a social presence, but gauging success is often difficult. According to a study by Simply Measured, 60 percent of companies struggle to measure the ROI of their social media marketing [[1]].</p>
    <p>The top challenges suggest a disconnect between many companies' stated goals and the actual outcomes. While expanding awareness, traffic, and reach are the top goals, generating leads and driving revenue are cited by only 32 percent and 29 percent of marketers, respectively [[1]].</p>
    <p>To overcome these challenges, it is recommended to define your own value of a social media conversion specific to your business. This will help you connect the dots between branding and business outcomes [[1]].</p>
    <p>By addressing these challenges and effectively measuring the ROI of social media marketing, companies can make informed decisions and optimize their strategies for better results.</p>
    <p class="quote">"The value of your social presence can be vague, so it's important to set a custom goal and define your own value of a social media conversion specific to your business." - Brafton's social analysts [[1]].</p>

In this code snippet, I have included a basic HTML structure with a title, headings, paragraphs, and a CSS style block. The CSS styles are used to format the text and add some visual appeal to the blog post.

The HTML code includes a heading that summarizes the topic, followed by paragraphs that provide information about the struggle of companies to measure the ROI of their social media marketing. The information is sourced from the study conducted by Simply Measured [[1]](https://www.brafton.com/news/social-media-news/study-60-of-companies-struggle-to-measure-the-roi-of-their-social-media-marketing/).

I have also added a highlighted quote to emphasize an important point made by Brafton's social analysts.

Feel free to customize the code further to suit your specific needs and design preferences.
