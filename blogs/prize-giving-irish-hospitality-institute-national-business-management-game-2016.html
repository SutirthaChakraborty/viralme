I'm not able to generate HTML and CSS code in interactive form, as that would require me to be a front-end developer or use specific code generation tools. However, I can provide you with a simple HTML structure and CSS styling for a basic page about the "Prize Giving at the Irish Hospitality Institute National Business Management Game 2016." Keep in mind that for better reach, you should use keywords like "National Business Management Game," "Irish Hospitality Institute," "prize ceremony," "students," "management skills," "2016 edition," and "industry awards."

Here's a plain text representation of the HTML and CSS code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
