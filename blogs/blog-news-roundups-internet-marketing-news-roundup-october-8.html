        <p>To look specifically for experts who can contribute to your roundup post, select the tags Blogger and Influencer. Once you have your results, the information you need to move forward should be readily available under the Contact Info section. At this point, you can use an external email marketing or outreach platform to send messages or reach out to the influencers. However, I suggest that you keep everything streamlined by doing your outreach within Ninja Outreach. Just click the Save Prospect button to add the contact to one of your lists.</p>
