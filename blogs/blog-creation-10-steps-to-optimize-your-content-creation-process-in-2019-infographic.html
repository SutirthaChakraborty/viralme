Here's a small HTML code with CSS that you can use to create a blog about optimizing your content creation process:

In this code, I've included CSS styles to make the blog visually appealing. The content is organized in a container with a white background and a box shadow. The headings and paragraphs have appropriate styles for readability. The infographic is centered and displayed with a maximum width of 100%.

To make the code interactive, you can add JavaScript functionality to enhance user experience, such as interactive elements or animations. However, since the specific requirements for interactivity were not mentioned, I have not included any JavaScript code in this example.

Remember to replace the placeholder image source (`infographic.jpg`) with the actual path to your infographic image.

Feel free to modify the code and customize it according to your needs. Good luck with your blog creation process!
