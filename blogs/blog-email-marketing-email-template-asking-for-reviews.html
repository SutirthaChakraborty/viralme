**Explanation:**
- The HTML structure includes a basic email template with a container for the email content.
- Inline CSS is used to style the email template, ensuring compatibility with various email clients.
- The template includes a heading, a message requesting feedback, and a call-to-action button for leaving a review.

**Interactive CSS and JS:**
The interactive elements and dynamic features in HTML email templates, such as interactive forms, surveys, polls, and hover effects for buttons, can be achieved using AMP for emails. AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) allows for interactive and engaging content within emails, enhancing the user experience and increasing conversions. Mailmodo offers 20+ interactive AMP widgets for embedding within emails, providing a tailored and interactive experience for recipients [[1]](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/html-emails/).

This HTML email template can be further customized and optimized based on specific email marketing requirements and branding guidelines. When creating and sending HTML emails, it's important to keep the CSS inline as much as possible to ensure consistent rendering across different email clients [[2]](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-responsive-html-email-template/). Additionally, providing a plain text version of the email is recommended for clients that don't support HTML or have HTML disabled [[2]](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-responsive-html-email-template/).
