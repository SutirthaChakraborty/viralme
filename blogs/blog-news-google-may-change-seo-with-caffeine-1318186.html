In the above HTML code, I have created a simple webpage for a blog news article about Google changing SEO with Caffeine. The code includes interactive CSS to style the webpage and make it visually appealing. Here are some key points about the code:

- The webpage has a title tag that reflects the topic of the blog news article: "Blog News: Google Changing SEO with Caffeine".
- The CSS code is embedded within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. It includes styles for the body, container, headings, paragraphs, and source citation.
- The content of the blog news article is structured using HTML tags such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>`. The article highlights the importance of Google's Caffeine update for SEO and provides tips for website owners and bloggers to adapt their SEO strategies.
- The `<ul>` tag is used to create a bulleted list of key points to consider for SEO optimization.
- The source citation is included at the end of the article using the `<p>` tag with the class "source". The sources are cited using the notation [[1]](https://www.greengeeks.com/blog/html-tags-for-seo/),, [[2]](https://www.link-assistant.com/news/html-tags-for-seo.html),.

Please note that this is a plain text representation of the HTML code. To use it in an actual webpage, you would need to save the code in a .html file and open it in a web browser.
