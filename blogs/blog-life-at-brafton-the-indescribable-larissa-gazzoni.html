        <h1>Life at Brafton - The Indescribable Larissa Gazzoni</h1>
        <p>Her planner isn't just for meetings and deadlines, but for medication reminders and appointments as well. She's in remission now and has taken charge of her life. Larissa works out and cares for her family every day.</p>
        <p>If you've ever met someone who defined what it means to be talented and kind, driven and focused, you're actually talking about Larissa Gazzoni.</p>
        <p>Larissa's life has always been about enrichment and exploring the world around her. In addition to being an avid art enthusiast and traveler, the college she went to, Puc Rio, is a private Catholic university. Instead of only focusing on the Catholic religion, the school introduces students to all types of ideologies and beliefs.</p>
        <p>And although liberal arts and design colleges force students to take prerequisite classes before diving into the core curriculum, this actually helped Larissa decide the type of design that she really loved to do.</p>
