      <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. This article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>

    <div class="news-item">
      <h2>Markdown Syntax</h2>
      <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is designed to be a really simple way to write in plain text and, with a few simple characters, tag it so that it will turn into really clean, really good HTML.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="news-item">
      <h2>Extended Syntax</h2>
      <p>Many Markdown processors support custom IDs for headings and syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. This feature allows you to add color highlighting for whatever language your code was written in.</p>

This HTML code provides a simple interactive news display with CSS styling and the potential for additional JavaScript functionality. It includes sections for "HTML Basics," "Markdown Syntax," and "Extended Syntax," each with a brief description of the topic. The CSS styles the news items with a border and background color, and JavaScript can be added for further interactivity, such as expandable/collapsible sections.
