In this code snippet, we have a basic HTML structure with a CSS style block. The CSS is used to create a responsive video container that maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio. The video is embedded using an iframe, and you can replace the `VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of your video.

The HTML content provides some insights and tips on optimizing videos for search engines. It includes suggestions such as using descriptive titles, writing detailed descriptions, adding relevant tags, transcribing content, creating a video sitemap, and promoting videos on social media.

Remember to replace the `VIDEO_ID` in the iframe with the actual ID of your video for it to work properly.

I hope this helps you optimize your videos for search engines!
