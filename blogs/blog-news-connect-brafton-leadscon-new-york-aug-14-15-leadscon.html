            <h2>Brafton</h2>
            <p>With our pillar page strategy, we've received 4x the traffic of a normal blog post, obtained 10x more newsletter subscriptions per page than an average blog, experienced lower bounce rates and had better organic results overall. A topic gateway content hub is a hybrid of the two previous models. It combines a content library with individual articles and subpages, offering readers a central location for exploring your topic in-depth. Where a content library covers more broad terms, a topic gateway is best suited for long-tail keywords.</p>
