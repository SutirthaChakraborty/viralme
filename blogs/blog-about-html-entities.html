  <h1>Understanding HTML Entities</h1>
  <p>
    HTML entities are used to display special characters and symbols that are not directly available on the keyboard. They are represented by their entity number or entity name. For example, &lt; represents the less-than symbol (<span class="important">important</span> for HTML).</p>
  <p>
    It's important to note that modern browsers handle most symbols just fine without the need for entity references, as long as the HTML's character encoding is set to UTF-8<sup>[[1]]</sup>.</p>
  <p>
    When creating a blog about HTML entities, it's essential to understand the purpose and usage of these entities in web development. They are particularly useful when dealing with special characters that may cause ambiguity if not displayed properly<sup>[[8]]</sup>.</p>
  <p>
    As you delve deeper into HTML, consider learning the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to enhance the visual presentation of your web content<sup>[[1]]</sup>.</p>
