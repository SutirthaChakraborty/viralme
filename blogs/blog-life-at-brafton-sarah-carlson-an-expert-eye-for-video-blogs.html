                <p>If you ask Brafton's Video Blog Studio Coordinator, Sarah Carlson, you may be surprised by the answer – if you recognize it at all, that is. At Brafton, Sarah is part of a close-knit team built around mutual respect and trust – and that's a working environment you can't find just anywhere. What's next for Sarah? Well, she's always on the lookout for a new film project to shoot or acapella group to join. Or she may just put together Boston's next big local band. Sarah couldn't ignore her passion for film, however, and in her junior year, decided to take an Intro to Cinema Media Studies class to see if it could light a spark. And boy did it ever. Right away, the class rekindled her lifelong love for film, video, and media, and she promptly switched majors one last time.</p>
