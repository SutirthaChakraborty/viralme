            <p>Social content is only as good as the audience it's targeted for. Facebook's latest move is to collect better information about organic content and paid ads in users' News Feeds. The evaporation of news feed visibility means brands need to be extremely careful when they cultivate social media marketing relationships with customers. The stakes may be even higher for paid ads.</p>

In the above HTML code, I've included a simple webpage layout with a header, and a section for blog posts related to Facebook's efforts to weed out irrelevant, repetitive, and spammy social content. The CSS styles are used to enhance the visual presentation of the content, including the styling of the blog post elements and the header. This code provides a basic structure for displaying blog news related to the specified topic.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this code to create a more comprehensive webpage for sharing blog news about Facebook's initiatives in managing social content.
