Google has been promoting contextual display ad targeting as a way to improve the relevance and effectiveness of ads for both advertisers and users.</p>\n    <p>To achieve this, Google uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and match it with relevant keywords and topics. This allows ads to be displayed more frequently and accurately, leading to higher click-through rates and conversions.</p>\n    <p>For example, if a user searches for information about a particular product or service, Google may show an ad for that product or service in their search results or on other websites they visit. By using contextual targeting, advertisers can reach their target audience more effectively and at a lower cost per conversion.</p>\n    <p>In addition to improving the relevance of ads, Google also offers tools for advertisers to track and optimize their campaigns based on performance metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and cost per acquisition. This allows businesses to make data-driven decisions about their advertising spend and improve their return on investment.</p>\n    <p class=\"highlight\">Keywords:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Contextual display ads</li>\n        <li>Google</li>\n        <li>Machine learning algorithms</li>\n        <li>Search history</li>\n        <li>Location</li>\n        <li>Browsing behavior</li>\n        <li>Click-through rates</li>\n        <li>Conversion rates</li>\n        <li>Cost per acquisition</li>\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>
