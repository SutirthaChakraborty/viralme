		<h1 class="title">5 Most Glorious Marketing Screw-Ups of All Time</h1>
		<p>Marketing is all about creativity, strategy, and execution. But sometimes, even the best marketers make mistakes. Here are 5 of the most glorious marketing screw-ups of all time:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Apple's "Macintosh 1984" Commercial Fail: Apple's iconic commercial was meant to revolutionize advertising, but it ended up being a flop. The company spent a fortune on the ad, only to see it fail to generate buzz.</li>
			<li>Walmart's "Save Money. Live Better." Campaign: Walmart's campaign was meant to rebrand the company as a more upscale retailer, but it ended up being ridiculed for its vagueness. The slogan was seen as too broad and failed to resonate with customers.</li>
			<li>Coca-Cola's "New Coke" Disaster: In the 1980s, Coca-Cola replaced its classic formula with a new one, sparking outrage from fans. The company was forced to bring back the original formula just a few months later.</li>
			<li>De Beers' "A Diamond is Forever" Campaign Fail: De Beers' campaign was meant to create a sense of scarcity around diamonds, but it ultimately backfired. The campaign was seen as manipulative and failed to increase sales.</li>
			<li>Facebook's "Dislike" Button Fail: Facebook's introduction of a "dislike" button was meant to give users more ways to express themselves, but it ended up being a flop. The feature was seen as too negative and was eventually scrapped.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These marketing screw-ups serve as a reminder that even the best marketers can make mistakes. But what's important is learning from those mistakes and moving forward.</p>
