    .social-media-buttons {
      list-style: none;
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
    }
    .social-media-buttons li {
      display: inline-block;

    }
    .social-media-buttons li a {

      width: 40px;
      height: 40px;
      line-height: 40px;
      text-align: center;
      color: #fff;
      border-radius: 50%;
    }
    /* Style for Facebook button */
    .facebook-button {
      background-color: #3b5998; /* Facebook blue */
    }
    .facebook-button:hover {
      background-color: #2d4373; /* Darker Facebook blue on hover */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <ul class="social-media-buttons">
    <li><a class="facebook-button" href="#">F</a></li>
    <!-- Add more social media buttons here -->
  </ul>
</body>
</html>


In this HTML code, we've created a simple list of social media buttons styled with CSS. The Facebook button is styled with the Facebook brand color. You can add more social media buttons and customize the styles as needed to match your website's design and branding.

For interactive features and JavaScript to drive Facebook likes, additional scripting and API integration would be required, which goes beyond the scope of this HTML and CSS example.
