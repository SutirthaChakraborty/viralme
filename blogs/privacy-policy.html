Sure! Here's a small HTML code snippet that includes CSS to create a basic privacy policy page:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Privacy Policy</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        .container {
            max-width: 800px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            padding: 20px;
        }

        h1 {
            color: #333;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }

        p {
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }

        .highlight {
            background-color: #f9f9f9;
            padding: 10px;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }

        .footer {
            text-align: center;
            margin-top: 50px;
            color: #888;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
