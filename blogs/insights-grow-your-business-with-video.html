In the above HTML code, I have provided a basic structure for a webpage that focuses on insights to grow your business with video. The code includes CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the page. Here are some key points about the code:

- The HTML code is wrapped in the `<html>` tags and includes a `<head>` section for defining the page title and linking the CSS styles.
- The CSS styles are defined within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section. They include styles for the body, container, headings, paragraphs, and a responsive video container.
- The content of the page is organized using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`).
- The video section includes a responsive video container that will automatically adjust its size based on the aspect ratio of the video.
- Replace `VIDEO_ID` in the `<iframe>` source with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed.

Feel free to customize the code further to meet your specific needs and design preferences.
