Sure! Here's an example of interactive, colorful HTML code that you can use to display information about Eileen Gray:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Eileen Gray</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightgray;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        
        h1 {
            color: darkblue;
        }
        
        p {
            color: black;
        }
        
        .quote {
            color: gray;
            font-style: italic;
        }
        
        .highlight {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
        
        .image {
            width: 300px;
            height: auto;
        }
    </style>
    <script>
        function highlightText() {
            var text = document.getElementById("quote").innerHTML;
            var highlightedText = "<span class='highlight'>" + text + "</span>";
            document.getElementById("quote").innerHTML = highlightedText;
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Eileen Gray</h1>
    <img src="eileen_gray.jpg" alt="Eileen Gray" class="image">
    <p>Eileen Gray was an influential Irish architect and furniture designer.</p>
    <p>She was born on August 9, 1878, and passed away on October 31, 1976.</p>
    <p>Gray's work was known for its innovative use of materials and her minimalist aesthetic.</p>
    <p class="quote" id="quote">"The future is gray."</p>
    <button onclick="highlightText()">Highlight Quote</button>
</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a webpage about Eileen Gray. It includes a heading, paragraphs of text, an image, and a quote. The CSS styles the elements with different colors, and the JavaScript function highlights the quote when the button is clicked.

Please note that you will need to replace the image source (`eileen_gray.jpg`) with the actual path to the image file on your server.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
