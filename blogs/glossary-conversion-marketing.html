    <script>

</body>
</html>


This HTML code creates a simple glossary page for conversion marketing. It includes definitions for key terms related to conversion marketing, such as "Conversion Marketing," "Conversion Rate," and "Call-to-Action (CTA)." The CSS styles the page with a clean and readable layout, using a sans-serif font, appropriate margins, and font sizes.

Feel free to customize the code by adding more definitions or modifying the CSS to suit your needs. You can also add interactive JavaScript to enhance the glossary page further, such as functionality to show/hide definitions on click.

Remember to replace the content within the `<title>` tag with a relevant title for your glossary page.
