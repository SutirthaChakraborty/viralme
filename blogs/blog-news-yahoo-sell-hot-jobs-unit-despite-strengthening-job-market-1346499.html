#### HTML Code with CSS for Blog News

Here's a small HTML code snippet with CSS that you can use for a blog news section:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Blog News</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styles for the blog news section */
        .blog-news {
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
            padding: 20px;
            border-radius: 5px;
        }

        .blog-news h2 {
            color: #333;
            font-size: 24px;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }

        .blog-news p {
            color: #666;
            font-size: 16px;
            line-height: 1.5;
        }

        .blog-news a {
            color: #007bff;
            text-decoration: none;
        }

        .blog-news a:hover {
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="blog-news">

In this code snippet, I've created a simple HTML structure with a `<div>` element that represents the blog news section. The CSS styles defined within the `<style>` tags are used to customize the appearance of the blog news section. The section has a light gray background, padding, and rounded corners. The heading and paragraphs are styled with appropriate font sizes and colors. The link to the source is styled with a blue color and underlined on hover.

Feel free to modify the code and add more content as needed. Remember to replace the placeholder link with the actual source link you want to reference.

By using this code as a starting point, you can create an interactive and visually appealing blog news section on your website.
