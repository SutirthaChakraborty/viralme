In the above HTML code, I have created a basic structure for a blog news webpage. The CSS styles are included within the `<style>` tags to customize the appearance of the webpage. The content of the blog news is written in plain text format, including information about the dominance of Google in the search engine market and the importance of incorporating search functionality into websites. The code also provides a brief guide on how to create a blog website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to modify the code and add more features to suit your specific requirements.
