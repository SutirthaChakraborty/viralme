#### Explanation of the HTML Code

The provided HTML code creates a simple FAQ page with a question and answer format. Here's an explanation of the different parts of the code:

- The `<style>` section contains CSS styles for the FAQ page, including font styles, background colors, and box shadows.
- The `<body>` section contains a container `<div>` that holds the FAQ content.
- The `<h1>` heading displays the title of the FAQ page.
- Each question is represented by a `<div>` element with the class "question". The `onclick` attribute is used to call a JavaScript function when the question is clicked.
- Each answer is represented by a `<div>` element with the class "answer" and a unique ID. The answers are initially hidden using the CSS property `display: none;`.
- The JavaScript function `toggleAnswer()` is responsible for toggling the visibility of the answers when a question is clicked. It adds or removes the "show" class from the answer `<div>`, which changes its display property to `block` or `none`.

Feel free to add more questions and answers to the HTML code as needed. Remember to update the JavaScript function accordingly to toggle the visibility of the new answers.
