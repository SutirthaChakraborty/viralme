With the latest update, users can now search for information by speaking their queries aloud. This is a great feature for those who are on the go or have difficulty typing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In addition to voice search, Google also offers image search. This allows users to search for images based on their visual content. For example, if you see an image of a cat, you can use Google's image search to find more pictures of cats online.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"interactive\">\n        <h2>Try it out!</h2>\n        <p>\n            Click the button below to try out Google's voice search and image search features.\n        </p>\n        <button onclick=\"alert('Hello, World!')\">Search with Voice</button>\n        <button onclick=\"alert('Image search not available yet')">Search with Image</button>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>
