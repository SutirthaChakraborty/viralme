In the above code, I have included CSS to style the HTML elements and make the content visually appealing. The CSS styles the body, headings, paragraphs, and highlights specific keywords with a different color and font weight. 

The code also includes a JavaScript function `toggleHighlight()` that toggles the CSS class `highlighted` on the elements with the class `highlight`. This demonstrates an interactive element where users can toggle the highlight on the keywords by clicking the "Toggle Highlight" button.

Please feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements.
